## Usage

<FAQ

  condensed={true}
  faqs={[
    {
      question: 'What is a (monthly) active patient?',
      answer: `
<span class='mb-4 inline-block'>A patient is active in a preceding month if any of the following occurred:</span>
‍
<ul>
<li>Care flow/pathway was started</li>
<li>Action was activated</li>
<li>Reminder was triggered</li>
</ul>

<div>
  Please note that the patient does not have to complete an action to be
  considered active. For example: if a reminder was sent to the patient, the
  patient is considered active.
</div>
<div class="mt-4">
  Whether a patient has 1 active flow and 1 activity in a given month, or 100
  flows with 1000 activities, that patient will be billed only once in that
  month

## Data

<FAQ
  withHeader={false}
  condensed={true}
  faqs={[
    {
      question: 'What is the current backup frequency for data in Awell?',
      answer: 'Once a day.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is data encrypted?',
      answer: `
<p>Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.</>
<p>Our database is deployed on a kubernetes cluster in the Google Kubernetes Engine. It is backed by a kubernetes persistent volume, which is covered by Google Cloud’s Default encryption of data at rest.</p>
<p>In cluster db connections use the HTTPS channel and therefore benefit from encryption in transit through TLS. HTTP access to the database is disabled to prevent connections without encryption in transit.</p>
  `,
    },
    {
      question:
        'How does Awell Health prevent sensitive (medical) data from being leaked?',
      answer: `
<p>We follow industry standard best practices to reduce the surface area of attack on the databases containing sensitive data (no sensitive data in logs, strong password rules enforced for database access, no shared credentials for database access, no public endpoint for databases, etc.). Internal access to those databases is granted only when necessary (ie. when troubleshooting issues).</p>
<p>We follow industry standard best practices for data encryption (data is encrypted at rest and in transit).</p>
<p>We are ISO27001 certified, which requires following strict hardware and software controls and staff training  to prevent data leaks.</p>
<p>In our multi tenants deployments, all data is logically isolated by tenant to prevent leaks between customers.</p>
      `,
    },
    {
      question:
        'Are all questions or data points and the corresponding answers uniquely identifiable in your system?',
      answer:
        'Yes. In addition, questions can be given a human readable identifier to support analytics queries.',
    },
    {
      question:
        'Can we assign custom attributes/tags to the Pathways? Will these custom tags be available in the Kibana Dashboards?',
