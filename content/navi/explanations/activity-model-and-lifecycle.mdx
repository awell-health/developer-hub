### What is an activity?

An activity is a single user task in a careflow (e.g., a form, checklist, message acknowledgement, or custom extension). Activities are orchestrated by the backend and rendered by the embedded portal.

### Supported activity types

- FORM, DYNAMIC_FORM
- CHECKLIST
- MESSAGE
- EXTENSION (coming soon)

These map to the userâ€‘facing types in the SDK and determine UI and validation behavior.

### Lifecycle

Navi emits structured events so you can react to lifecycle changes:

- activity-ready: mounted and ready
- activity-activate: becomes the active step
- activity-progress: progress changed (e.g., required fields)
- activity-data-change: value changed (field, currentData)
- activity-complete: submitted successfully
- activity-error: validation or runtime error
- activity-focus / activity-blur: focus changes

Example (React):

```tsx
<NaviEmbed
  careflowDefinitionId="cfdef_12345"
  onActivityComplete={(e) => console.log("submitted", e)}
  onActivityProgress={(e) => console.log("progress", e.data?.progress)}
  onActivityError={(e) => console.error(e.data?.error)}
/>
```

### Data and validation

- Input validation happens inside the iframe; invalid inputs emit activity-error.
- On submit, Navi tokenizes and transmits only the data needed for processing.
- After completion, the backend advances the careflow, which may load the next activity or complete the session.
