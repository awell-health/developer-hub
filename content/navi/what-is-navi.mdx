## What is Navi?

Navi is Awell’s drop‑in, production‑ready experience layer for healthcare workflows. Think Stripe Checkout, but for care: a secure, 
branded UI that you can embed in your product to guide patients and care teams through high‑value journeys with best‑practice UX, 
validation, and analytics out of the box.

## Why it matters

- Faster time‑to‑value: Launch embedded care experiences in minutes instead of weeks of bespoke UI/API work.
- Higher completion: Opinionated flows reduce friction and increase patient follow‑through.
- Lower delivery risk: Security, compliance, and edge‑case handling are built‑in and continuously maintained.
- Operate, don’t rebuild: Configure steps, copy, and rules in Awell Studio without re‑shipping your app.
- Extend anywhere: Modern SDKs and hooks for seamless monitoring, responsive site behavior, or analytics.

## How it works

1. Design or adapt the flow in Awell Studio.
2. Embed Navi with a few lines of code.
3. Track completion and outcomes, iterate with configuration—not code.

## When to use Navi

- Patient intake, onboarding, and consent
- Guided task completion for care teams
- PROMs, surveys, and education modules
