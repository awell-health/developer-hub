## Create a New Git Repository

Begin by setting up a dedicated Git repository for Awell's Source Control. While you can link to an existing repository, starting fresh with a new one is advised for optimal integration. This approach not only ensures a clean slate but also provides you with a unique URL for your project. Remember to copy this new URL once created, as you'll need it for subsequent steps. Here's what your new repository's URL will look like:

```
https://gitlab.com/<org>/[<group>/]<project>
```

## Enter your URL into Awell

To integrate your repository with Awell, follow these steps:

- Go to the Care flow that you want to source control.
- Click on the **Settings** tab.
- Under the settings menu, on the left, click on **Source Control**.
- Paste your new URL from the previous step into the **Repository URL** field.

## Branch Name

Write the name of the branch you would like your care flow to be pushed to. If you are unsure what to name it, we recommend using `main`.

## Create a Personal Access Token

1. Generate your PAT [here](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens). Keep in mind, the token must be a _personal_ access token, and not a _project_ access token (which is created at the project level).
2. Select `read_repository` and `write_repository` as the scopes.
3. Select a reasonable expiration date and save to your password vault or somewhere secure.

## Copy the Generated Token into Awell

- Go to the Care flow you want to source control.
- Click on the **Settings** tab.
- Under the settings menu, on the left, click on **Source Control**.
- Paste your new token from the previous step into the **GitHub access token** box.

## Hit "Test Source Control"

## Hit Save

**Do not forget to hit the Save button** on the bottom right. Your care flow is now source-controlled!

> **NOTE:** Every time you publish a care flow it will be pushed to the GitHub repository.
