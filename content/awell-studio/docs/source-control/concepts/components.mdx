## Disclaimer

The representation of a care flow in code, including its folder structure and components, is currently in an experimental phase. Awell may implement substantial changes to this structure without prior notification.

## Syntax

Your care flow and its components will be stored as JSON files.

## Folder structure

When you care flow is synced to your repository, the directory will contain your care flow components as code (JSON), split into the following files and directories.

```
repository
└── actions
    └── actions.json
└── data_point_definitions
    └── data_point_definitions.json
└── labels
    └── labels.json
└── messages
    └── messages.json
└── pathways
    └── pathways.json
└── rules
    └── rules.json
└── settings
    └── settings.json
└── stakeholders
    └── stakeholders.json
└── steps
    └── steps.json
└── timings
    └── timings.json
└── tracks
    └── tracks.json
└── transitions
    └── transitions.json
└── triggers
    └── triggers.json
└── README.md
```

## Components

[A care flow is a sum of components](/awell-studio/docs/getting-started/versioning#a-care-flow-as-a-set-of-components), learn more about all the different components below.

### Actions

The most granular building block in a care flow. Actions define what needs to be done and by whom. They can be stakeholder-actionable actions (like forms) or system actions (like calculations or API calls).

### API calls

Contains definitions of external API calls that are part of the care flow.

### Data point definitions

Holds the definitions of various data points used within the care flow.

### Forms

Includes the forms required in the care flow for data input or interaction.

### Labels

Contains labels used for categorizing or marking different parts of the care flow.

### Messages

Stores predefined messages or communication templates used in the care flow.

### Pathways

The high-level structure of a care flow, outlining the sequence and connection of steps and actions.

### Questions

Contains questions that may be asked during the care flow, often part of forms or decision-making processes.

### Rules

Defines the rules or logic that govern the flow of the care flow, like conditional branching.

### Settings

Holds configuration settings specific to the care flow.

### Stakeholders

Lists the different stakeholders or user roles involved in the care flow.

### Steps

Represents the individual steps within a track of a care flow.

### Timings

Contains information related to the timing aspects of the care flow, like scheduling or time-based triggers.

### Tracks

Broad categorizations or groupings of steps in a care flow.

### Transitions

Details the transitions between different states or stages of the care flow.

### Triggers

Defines the triggers that initiate or advance stages within the care flow.
