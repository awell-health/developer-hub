description: Learn how to make changes to care flows protected with Source Control

Protected care flows are editable in Awell Studio by anyone but publication is exclusive to changes merged into the master branch via your Source Control Management (SCM) provider like GitHub.

This enables your organization to empower anyone to design care flows, while still granting engineers ultimate control over when a care flow is ready for publication. **This creates a robust approval workflow**, particularly beneficial when your care flows are closely integrated with or interact with proprietary systems, ensuring engineers can deploy with confidence.
