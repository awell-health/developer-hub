description: Manage changes to care flows using SCM providers like GitHub.

Source Control allows you to manage changes to care flows on remote source control management (SCM) providers, such as GitHub. When Source Control is set up, your care flow is synced as code to your repository every time you publish a new version of your care flow.

Syncing care flows with SCM tools has many benefits:

1. **Care flows-as-code:** by treating care flow components as code you have unparalleled control and ownership.
2. **Direct integration with CI/CD pipelines:** seamlessly incorporate care flow updates into your existing CI/CD systems.
3. **Code-based testing:** verify the functionality of care flows through your code-testing protocols.
4. **Diffing:** inspect and view changes between different versions of your care flow through code
