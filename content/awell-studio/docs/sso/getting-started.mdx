Awell supports integration with various Identity Providers (IdPs) like Okta, Google, and others. Integrating your IdP with Awell allows your users to access Awell's platform using the same credentials they use within your organization.

## Step 1: Reach out to us

Setting up SSO is not something that can be done via our applications. Instead, reach out to Awell support if you want SSO set up for your organization. We are committed to making this process as seamless as possible for you. With your request, we ask you to provide the following details:

- Your organization's name
- The name of your Identity Provider (Okta, Google, etc.)

## Step 2: Gather integration details

The integration process involves configuring your IdP and coordinating with Awell. Here's what you need to prepare:

1. **Configure Your IdP**: Gather your IdP's metadata, which typically includes information like the IdP URL and the certificate used for SSO. This metadata is crucial for Awell to establish a trust relationship with your IdP.
2. **Send Integration Details to Awell**: Once your IdP is configured, provide Awell with the metadata from your IdP to proceed with the integration.
3. **Coordinate with Awell support**: Collaborate with Awell's support team to finalize the SSO integration. They will guide you through the final steps and validate the setup.

For detailed steps on integrating specific IdPs with Awell, refer to our individual integration guides.
