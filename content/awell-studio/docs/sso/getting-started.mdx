description: Integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) with Awell using Identity Providers like Okta for seamless authentication.
---

Awell supports integration with various Identity Providers (IdPs) like Okta, Google, and others. Integrating your IdP with Awell allows your users to access Awell's platform using the same credentials they use within your organization. 

## Step 1: Inform Awell Support

SSO integration is not self-serve at Awell, so before you start the configuration, contact Awell support to express your intention to set up SSO with an IdP. Provide:

- Your organization's name.
- Confirmation of the name of the IdP that will be used as the Identity Provider (Okta, Google etc.).


## Step 2: Gather Integration Details

The integration process involves configuring your IdP and coordinating with Awell. Here's what you need to prepare:

1. **Choose Your IdP**: Select an identity provider that is compatible with Awell's requirements.
2. **Configure Your IdP**: Gather your IdP's metadata, which typically includes information like the IdP URL and the certificate used for SSO. This metadata is crucial for Awell to establish a trust relationship with your IdP.
3. **Send Integration Details to Awell**: Once your IdP is configured, provide Awell with the metadata from your IdP to proceed with the integration:
4. **Coordinate with Awell Support**: Collaborate with Awell's support team to finalize the SSO integration. They will guide you through the final steps and validate the setup.
