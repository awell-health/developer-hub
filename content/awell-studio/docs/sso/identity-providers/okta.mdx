## Prerequisites
- An active Okta account with administrative access.
- An Awell account with permissions to configure SSO settings.

## Step 1: Inform Awell Support

Before you start the configuration, contact Awell support to express your intention to set up SSO with Okta. Provide:

- Your organization's name.
- Confirmation that Okta will be used as the Identity Provider.

## Step 2: Create an Okta Application

- **Log in to Okta Admin Dashboard**:
   - Access your Okta admin account.

- **Add Awell Application**:
   - Navigate to **Applications**.
   - Click **Add Application**.
   - Search for Awell and add it as an application.

## Step 3: Configure SAML Settings in Okta

- **Access the Awell Application in Okta**:
   - Select the Awell application from your list of applications.

- **Edit SAML Settings**:
   - Go to the **Sign On** tab in the Awell application.
   - Click **Edit** in the SAML settings section.

- **Set up SAML Configuration**:
   - Enter the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL and Entity ID as provided by Awell.
   - Adjust other settings as necessary according to Awell's specifications.

## Step 4: Assign Users in Okta

- Assign individual users or groups to the Awell application in Okta to grant them access.

## Step 5: Provide Okta Metadata to Awell

- **Locate Identity Provider Metadata**:
   - In your Okta Awell application, find the link to the Identity Provider metadata.

- **Send Metadata to Awell**:
   - Email the metadata link to Awell's support team for them to complete the configuration on their end.

## Final Steps
