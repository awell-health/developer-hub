---

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to integrate Okta with Awell for Single Sign-On (SSO), allowing users within your organization to access Awell using their Okta credentials.

## Prerequisites

- An active Okta account with administrative access.
- An Awell account with permissions to configure SSO settings. You will receive **ACS URL**, **Audience URI** and **Connection ID** from Awell upon request to set up SSO.

## How to

### Step 1: Create and configure a new Okta Application

Follow the instructions mentioned in guidelines provided by Okta: [Add an Okta SAML application](https://help.okta.com/oag/en-us/content/topics/access-gateway/add-app-saml-pass-thru-add-okta.htm).

### Step 2: Create SAML app integration

Follow the instructions mentioned in guidelines provided by Okta:

- [Create SAML app integration](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_saml.htm)
- In the Configure SAML form, use these values for the following fields:
   - **Single sign-on URL**: Enter the `acs_url` value provided by Awell.
   - **Use this for Recipient URL** and Destination URL should remain checked.
   - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: Enter the `audience_uri` value provided by Awell.
   - **Default RelayState**: This value can remain blank.
   - **Name ID format**: Select `EmailAddress`.
   - **Application username**: Any value here should suffice.
   - **Attribute Statements**: Create these data inputs:
      - Name: `firstName`; Name format: `Basic`; Value: `user.firstName`
      - Name: `lastName`; Name format: `Basic`; Value: `user.lastName`

### Step 3: Gather SAML Configuration details from Okta

- Click the **View SAML setup instructions** button on the **Sign On** tab of your newly created Okta application
- You'll need to extract and save the following Okta values:
   - **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL**
   - **X.509 Certificate** (including the `BEGIN_CERTIFICATE` and `END_CERTIFICATE` lines)
   - **Identity Provider Issuer**

### Step 4: Assign Users in Okta

Assign individual users or groups to the Awell application in Okta to grant them access.

### Step 5: Provide Okta Details to Awell

**Send Details to Awell**: Send the metadata link along with the configuration details gathered in Step 3 to Awell's support team for them to complete the configuration on their end.

### Final Steps

- After Awell confirms the integration setup, conduct a test login with an assigned user to ensure the SSO is functioning correctly.
- For any issues during the setup or after integration, reach out to Awell support for assistance.

Remember to keep Awell updated about any changes in your Okta configuration that may affect the SSO integration.
