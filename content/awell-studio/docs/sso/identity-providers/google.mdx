---

This guide outlines the process for integrating Google as your Identity Provider (IdP) with Awell for Single Sign-On (SSO). This allows users in your organization to access Awell using their Google credentials.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Google Workspace Admin Console with administrative privileges.
- An Awell account with permissions to configure SSO settings. You will receive **ACS URL** and **Entity ID** from Awell upon request to set up SSO.

## How to

### Step 1: Set Up SAML App in Google Workspace

Follow the instructions mentioned in guidelines provided by Google:

- [Set up your own custom SAML app](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6087519)
- [Configure the SSO profile for your organization](https://support.google.com/a/answer/12032922?hl=en#org_profile)

After this step, you should have **Awell SAML App** setup and **SSO profile** created for your organization.

### Step 2: Gather SAML Configuration details from Google Workspace

- Navigate to the Awell SAML app in your Google Workspace.
- **Edit SAML Settings**:
   - Click **Set up single sign-on (SSO)**.
   - Enter the ACS URL and Entity ID as provided by Awell.
   - Download the Google IdP metadata.

### Step 3: Assign Users in Google Workspace

In the Awell SAML app settings, configure which users or groups should have access to Awell.

### Step 4: Provide Google Metadata to Awell

- **Email Google IdP Metadata**:
   - Send the downloaded Google IdP metadata file to Awell's support team for the final configuration.
   - This metadata should contain **Entity ID**, **SSO URL** and **x509_certificate**.

### Final Steps

- Once Awell confirms the SSO integration setup, perform a test login using an assigned user account to ensure the integration is functioning correctly.
- For any setup or post-integration issues, contact Awell support for assistance.

**Note**: Keep Awell informed about any changes in your Google configuration that might affect the SSO integration.
