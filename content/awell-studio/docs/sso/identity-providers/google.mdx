This guide outlines the process for integrating Google as your Identity Provider (IdP) with Awell for Single Sign-On (SSO). This allows users in your organization to access Awell using their Google credentials.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Google Workspace Admin Console with administrative privileges.
- An Awell account with permissions to configure SSO settings.

## Step 1: Inform Awell Support

Initiate the SSO integration process by contacting Awell support. Provide the following information:

- Your organization's name.
- Confirmation that Google will be used as the Identity Provider.

## Step 2: Set Up SAML App in Google Workspace

- **Log in to Google Workspace Admin Console**:
   - Sign in with your administrator account.

- **Add Awell as a SAML App**:
   - Go to **Apps > SAML apps**.
   - Select **Add a Service/App to your domain**.
   - Find and select Awell in the app catalog.

## Step 3: Configure SAML Settings in Google Workspace

- **Access the Awell SAML App Settings**:
   - Navigate to the Awell SAML app in your Google Workspace.

- **Edit SAML Settings**:
   - Click **Set up single sign-on (SSO)**.
   - Enter the ACS URL and Entity ID as provided by Awell.
   - Download the Google IdP metadata.

## Step 4: Assign Users in Google Workspace

- In the Awell SAML app settings, configure which users or groups should have access to Awell.

## Step 5: Provide Google Metadata to Awell

- **Email Google IdP Metadata**:
   - Send the downloaded Google IdP metadata file to Awell's support team for the final configuration.

## Final Steps

- Once Awell confirms the SSO integration setup, perform a test login using an assigned user account to ensure the integration is functioning correctly.
- For any setup or post-integration issues, contact Awell support for assistance.
