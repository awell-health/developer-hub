## What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications and services with a single set of credentials. This method simplifies the sign-in process, reducing the need for multiple passwords and enhancing overall security. SSO is particularly beneficial in corporate environments where users frequently access a suite of interconnected applications.

## Key Benefits of SSO

- **Simplified access**: Users enjoy a seamless login experience across various services without the need to remember multiple passwords.
- **Enhanced security**: Reduces the likelihood of password fatigue and the security risks associated with it.
- **Improved productivity**: Streamlines the workflow as users can quickly switch between different applications.
- **Ease of administration**: Simplifies the management of user access and credentials for system administrators.

## Common SSO Protocols

- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**: An open standard that allows identity providers to pass authorization credentials to service providers.
- **OpenID Connect**: A simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, used for verifying the end user's identity.
- **OAuth 2.0**: An authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts.

## Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning

Normally, users have to be invited and manually created in Awell platform. With JIT provisioning in an SSO environment, user accounts are created and assigned to your organization automatically upon their first sign-in. This process significantly streamlines user management:

- **Automated account creation**: When a user first logs in via SSO, their account is automatically created in Awell.
- **Immediate access**: Users have immediate access to Awell without the need for manual account creation or invitations.
- **Efficient user management**: Reduces the administrative burden of managing user accounts, as they are provisioned and managed directly through the SSO process.
