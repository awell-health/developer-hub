## What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?

**Awell provides Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality allowing your users to access all of Awell's applications through your identity provider.** It works by passing the userâ€™s identity from one place (your identity provider) to another (Awell, the service provider).

This method simplifies the sign-in process, reducing the need for multiple passwords and enhancing overall security.

## Key Benefits of SSO

- **Simplified access**: users enjoy a seamless login experience without the need to create and remember another password in Awell.
- **Enhanced security**: reduces the likelihood of password fatigue and the security risks associated with it.
- **Ease of administration**: simplifies the management of user access and credentials for system administrators.

## Common SSO Protocols

- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**: an open standard that allows identity providers to pass authorization credentials to service providers.
- **OpenID Connect**: a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, used for verifying the end user's identity.
- **OAuth 2.0**: an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts.

## Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning

Typically, users must be invited invited and manually created in Awell. With JIT provisioning in an SSO environment, user accounts are created and assigned to your organization automatically upon their first sign-in. This process significantly streamlines user management:

- **Automated account creation**: when a user first logs in via SSO, their account is automatically created in Awell.
- **Immediate access**: users have immediate access to Awell without the need for manual account creation or invitations.
- **Efficient user management**: reduces the administrative burden of managing user accounts, as they are provisioned and managed directly through the SSO process.
