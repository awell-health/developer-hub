## Building blocks

When designing a care flow, you will use the following types of building blocks:

<div className="grid gap-6 mx-auto grid-cols-3">
  <div className="grid items-center grid-flow-col p-4 bg-slate-100 rounded-2xl dark:bg-slate-400">
    <div className="flex justify-center">
      <div className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 text-center my-6 dark:text-slate-100">
        Tracks with triggers
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="grid items-center grid-flow-col p-4 bg-slate-100 rounded-2xl dark:bg-slate-400">
    <div className="flex justify-center">
      <div className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 text-center my-6 dark:text-slate-100">
        Steps and transitions
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="grid items-center grid-flow-col p-4 bg-slate-100 rounded-2xl dark:bg-slate-400">
    <div className="flex justify-center">
      <div className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 text-center my-6 dark:text-slate-100">
        Actions assigned to stakeholders
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

These building blocks are the result of many iterations of the Awell Platform to come to a visual workflow modeling language that is fit for healthcare processes.

### Tracks and triggers

Tracks operate on a declarative model, activating in response to specific events (triggers) within the care flow.

### Steps and transitions

Within a track, you will use steps connected by transitions. This modeling resembles what is commonly found in flowchart and BPMN tools, where processes are created by placing steps onto a canvas and linking them with arrows.

### Actions

**An action is the most low level and granular building block** in a care flow. Compared to tracks and steps which purely help you organizing a care flow , **it defines what needs to happen by who**.

Actions within the system are categorized based on whether they require completion by a real user (stakeholder) or are automatically executed by the system. These are identified as user-actionable actions (such as filling out a form) and system actions (also known as non-user-actionable actions), which include processes like performing calculations and making API calls.

## Deviating from BPMN standards

Note that we have deviated on purpose from Business Process Modeling (BPM) language despite it being considered a standard process modeling language. The main reason is that healthcare processes are significantly different from regular business processes and they have several unique requirements that are not solved in BPMN.
