## What is Awell Studio?

Awell Studio is a low-code tool built by Awell and used by clinical and product teams to **design, build, and publish care flows**. Once a care flow is published, it can be orchestrated for patients using [Awell Orchestration](/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/orchestration-introduction).

## What is a care flow?

**Care flows go by many different names:** care plan, clinical workflow, care pathway, care journey, clinical protocol, patient onboarding flow, care program and many more. In principle, care flows are a sequence of activities performed by the care team and/or the patient to achieve or maintain a desired health state for that patient.

  <p>In the Awell platform, you'll find that <strong>care flows and pathways</strong> are used interchangeably.</p>
