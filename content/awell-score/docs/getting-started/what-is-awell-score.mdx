**Awell Score is an API developed by the Awell team**. It's a standalone microservice that can be used to calculate validated scores for clinical & patient reported outcome measures.

## Difference with Awell Orchestration

When using our Orchestration platform, you use Awell Studio to build your care flows first. In these care flows you have the ability to use "calculation actions". When the pathwhay is then operated, it will call the Awell Score API to get the results for those calculations. We thus leverage the Awell Score API ourselves in our Orchestration platform.

However, the Awell Score API can also be consumed as a standlone API and thus outside the context of a care flow.

## EU MDD Device Classification

**Awell Score is CE marked and MDD Class IA certified since March 2021.** This is an important quality indicator as all existing and future calculations need to pass a rigorous testing plan to make sure they are reliable and valid.
