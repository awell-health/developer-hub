<Alert type="info" title="Compatibility and API version">
  <p>Please note that this endpoint can only be used if you also use the <a href="/awell-score/docs/api-reference/perform-calculation">v2 endpoint</a> to perform calculations as the v1 endpoint does not return an `id` for the calculation result that you need to call this endpoint.</p>
</Alert>

## Request

### Endpoint

<p>
  <span className="pr-2 font-semibold text-sky-500 dark:text-sky-400">GET</span>
  <span className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 font-semibold">
    {`/v2/calculations/result/{id}`}
  </span>
</p>

### Path parameters

This endpoint expects an `id` to be passed as a path parameter. This id represents the identifier of a calculation result which is returned when the calculation was first performed (see "[perform calculation](/awell-score/docs/api-reference/perform-calculation)").
