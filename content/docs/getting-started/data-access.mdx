# Webhooks

Webhooks are triggered for every form that is submitted and every data point that is collected. For more information, read [this page](/docs/integrations/webhooks).

# Elastic search

We use Elastic as a data repository to store, index, and search data sets. You can either **connect your own BI tool** to our data sets in Elastic or **use our analytics & dashboarding tool: Kibana**.

Both Elastic and Kibana are running on our own infrastructure.

# Kibana

We use Kibana for dashboarding & data visualization. If you choose to work with Kibana (and not your own BI tool) then we create accounts so you can log in into the tool. In Kibana, you're able to create an unlimited amount of dashboards.

Integrations with your identity provider to log into Kibana are also possible.
