## Webhook configuration

Webhooks can be configured on a per pathway basis in Awell Studio (see `Settings > Webhooks`). See the <a href="https://help.awellhealth.com/en/" target="_blank">Awell Studio documentation</a> for more information on how to configure Webhooks.

Webhooks can be configured separately for pathway preview (when building and testing pathways) and for pathway orchestration. In addition, when previewing pathways all webhooks are skipped by default but you have the ability to trigger them manually to test your endpoint implementation.

## Available events

Currently each configured endpoint receives all of the available events:

- <u>Activity created:</u> triggered every time an activity in the pathway is created,
  including system activities.
- <u>Activity completed:</u> triggered every time an activity in the pathway is completed,
  including system activities.{' '}
- <u>Data point collected:</u> triggered every time a new value for a data point
  is collected
- <u>Form submitted:</u> triggered every time a form is submitted

> More granular configuration for webhooks is coming soon with the ability to select one or more events you want to receive on a specific endpoint.

See the [API Reference](/api-reference/overview/endpoints) for more information about the available events, including sample payloads.

## Security

We value security & privacy, especially because we're handling sensistive healthcare data. As a company, we're doing our best to stay ahead of attackers by fixing and guarding the loopholes in our systems.

Outlined below are the strategies we use to faciliate security when working with webhooks. We're open to discuss additional measures if needed.

### Encryption (HTTPS)

We only allow HTTPS webhook endpoints. This provides security at the transport layer, ensuring that all data sent is encrypted and therefore cannot be read.

### Headers to verify the source

Headers can be configured for all outgoing webhooks that are sent by our system. An authentication token can thus be added to the header you can validate that token to verify whether the incoming request is coming from the right source.

### Whitelisting

Another way to verify the source is for you to be aware of our IP address. You can whitelist this IP address and bounce any other request coming from unknown IP addresses.
