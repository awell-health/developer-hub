title: Monthly active patients (MAPs)
description: Understand our pricing by understanding what a monthly active patient is
---

The definition of a monthly active patient (MAP) is based on whether an activity in a workflow was orchestrated for a given patient. **This means that you're not billed for the use of Awell Studio, only for Awell Orchestration.**

## Operating a clinical workflow

Whenever Awell Orchestration operates a clinical workflow, it processes the flow built in Awell Studio and translates it to a set of activities that represent the pathway of an individual patient.

## What is an active patient?

**A patient is active if Awell Orchestration performed at least one of the following activities for that patient:**

1. Pathway was started or completed
2. Action was activated
3. Reminder was triggered

Please note that the patient does not need to have been active themselves. For example, the sending of a reminder marks that patient as active.

## FAQ

**Does it matter how many activities are operated for a patient?**<br/>
No. Whether Awell Orchestration operated 1 or 1000 activities for a given patient in a given month, that patient will be billed only once in that month. This means we do not disincentivise you from building pathways with many activities, on the contrary.

**If an action was activated in June but completed in July, will the patient be considered active in both June & July?**<br/>
No. To avoid billing twice for the same action, we only take activation of an action into account. If a form has been made available for a patient in June but submitted in July, that patient will be billed only in June.
