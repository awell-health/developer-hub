## How can I collect observations from a care flow ?

In your care flow, you can collect observations by adding a calculation action. Each action generates an ObservationDefinition resource. If multiple observation definitions have the same code, they are merged together. For example, you might add a PHQ-9 score calculation to monitor a patient’s mental health.

## How can I drive care flow logic with observation data ?

Observations are key to driving conditional logic within care flows. For example, you can configure your care flow to schedule a consultation with a psychologist if a patient’s PHQ-9 score is 15 or higher, indicating depression. This allows for dynamic adjustments based on real-time data.
