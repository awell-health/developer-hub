title: Diagnostics data
description: What diagnostics data is available in Awell ?
---

Our system uses the following resources to capture diagnostic data, based on the FHIR standard:

- **ObservationDefinition** and **Observation**: Captures clinical scores or any other measurements made about a patient.
- **Questionnaire** and **QuestionnaireResponse**: Captures forms assigned to stakeholders in the care flow and their responses.

The diagram below shows how these resources relate to one another as well as their relationship to the care flow parent resource.
