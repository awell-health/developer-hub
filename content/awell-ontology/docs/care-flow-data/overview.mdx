title: Care flow data
description: How is a care flow modeled in the Awell Ontology ?
---

Our system uses the **CarePlan** and **PlanDefinition** resources to model care flows, based on the FHIR standard:
- **PlanDefinition**: A care flow that you design in Awell Studio. See [Awell Studio](/awell-studio/docs/getting-started/studio-introduction) for more information on how to design care flows.
- **CarePlan**: A care flow that has been started for a specific patient using the Awell Orchestration platform. See [Awell Orchestration](/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/orchestration-introduction) for more information on how to orchestrate care flows.


The diagram below shows how these resources relates to one another.
