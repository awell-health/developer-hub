## What is the Awell Ontology?

With Awell you can design and orchestrate care flows that can be infinitely complex. In these care flows you can exchange and interpret data coming from multiple different systems. The Awell Ontology is an exhaustive and systematic documentation of all the objects you will use in your care flow designer journey, as well as their properties and how they relate to one another.

Our ontology is based on the FHIR framework in order to simplify the data exchange with other systems. As a side benefit it should feel familiar for anyone with a base level knowledge of FHIR.
