## What is the Awell Ontology?

Awell enables you to design and manage care flows with ease, integrating data from various systems effortlessly. The Awell Ontology serves as a comprehensive documentation, detailing all the objects you will use in your care flow design journey, their properties, and how they interconnect.

## Why use a FHIR based ontology ?

Our ontology is based on the FHIR framework as this is a widely-recognize standard in the healthcare industry. It facilitates data exchange between healthcare systems, ensuring interoperability and ease of integration.

## What are the benefits of a FHIR based ontology ?

There are two key benefits:
- It simplifies the data exchange between systems
- It helps translate clinical concepts into actionable care flow components

Imagine for example being able to use something like this to not just identify patient cohorts but also to use as a basis for designing and operating care flows:

> From the ADT feeds received in the last 3 days, start a follow-up care flow for every person taking sitagliptin with an A1C above 6.5 measured in the last 14 days even if they've never been diagnosed with diabetes.

This illustrates the power of the FHIR based ontology
- Messages from an ADT feed can easily be converted into data that can be used in care flows.
- Clinical concepts are translated into actionable care flow components:
  - A1C level is an **Observation** (already available in the Awell Ontology).
  - Sitagliptin is a medication (soon to be added as **MedicationRequest** and **MedicationDispense** resources in the Awell Ontology).
  - Diabetes is a **Diagnosis** (soon to be added in the Awell Ontology).
