This page describes the major concepts related to the Ontology in Awell.

## Resource type

A Resource type is the schema definition of a real-world entity, event, or functional intent. In FHIR, there are [more than 150 resource types](https://build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html) available to classify healthcare data.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: '200px' }}>Ontology</th>
      <th style={{ width: '250px' }}>Example 1</th>
      <th>Example 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Resource type</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Patient</td>
      <td>Observation</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Resource

A Resource refers to a single instance of a Resource type and thus corresponds to a single real-world entity, event, or functional intent.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: '200px' }}>Ontology</th>
      <th style={{ width: '250px' }}>Example 1</th>
      <th>Example 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Resource type</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Patient</td>
      <td>Observation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Resource</strong>
      </td>
      <td>John Doe's patient record</td>
      <td>Hemoglobin measurement</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Property and Property value

A property defines a specific characteristic of a Resource. It has a name which defines what that characteristic represents, and a value which defines what that characteristic is.

> **Note**: in FHIR, properties are called Elements.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: '200px' }}>Ontology</th>
      <th style={{ width: '250px' }}>Example 1</th>
      <th>Example 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Resource type</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Patient</td>
      <td>Observation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Resource</strong>
      </td>
      <td>John Doe's patient record</td>
      <td>Hemoglobin measurement</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Property (name)</strong>
      </td>
      <td>birthDate</td>
      <td>valueQuantity.value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Property value</strong>
      </td>
      <td>1993-11-30</td>
      <td>7.2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Semantic properties

Some properties contain semantic information about a resource. This category of properties is referred to as a **Semantic Property** and is mostly frequently used when you want to search for data when designing care flows.

Let's say for example that you are building a care flow related to depression and want to create treatment activities that are relevant only for patients that are likely to be depressed. When you search for the term `depression` we can find the **PHQ-9** Observation thanks to its `code` property as it contains information about what the observation measures (Loinc 44249-1: "PHQ-9 quick depression assessment panel").

### Actionable properties

Some properties contain values that can be used to drive the logic in a care flow or tailor its content. This category of properties is referred to as an **Actionable Property**.

Building up on the previous example, once you've identified that the **PHQ-9** observation has the information that you need, you can configure treatment activities that will only be activated when the observation `value` (Actionable Property of an Observation) is higherÂ greater or equal to 10, which indicates a moderate or higher level of depression.

## Reference

**A Reference defines the relationship (or join) between two resources.** Many of the defined properties in a Resource are references to other resources. Using these references, the resources combine to build a web of information about healthcare.

For example, the FHIR resource type Condition has a subject field of Reference type, which can be used to link to a Patient resource as the subject of the condition.

## Data store

**The collection of Resource types and Resources that describes all the healthcare data available in your account (the data layer).** This evolves with the care flows that you build and the systems that you connect to Awell.

The structure of data storage can be reverse-engineered into the Ontology. This mapping can help in visualizing the correlation between the raw data and the Ontology framework, aiding in the understanding of data relationships and structure.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: '250px' }}>Data store (relational)</th>
      <th style={{ width: '250px' }}>Data store (NoSQL)</th>
      <th>Ontology</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Table</td>
      <td>Collection</td>
      <td>Resource type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Row</td>
      <td>Document</td>
      <td>Resource</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Column</td>
      <td>Field</td>
      <td>Property</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Field</td>
      <td>Value</td>
      <td>Property value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Join</td>
      <td>Linking</td>
      <td>Reference</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
