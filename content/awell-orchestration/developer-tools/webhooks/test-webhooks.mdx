We allow you to easily test webhooks via the care flow/pathway preview.

## Test endpoint vs production endpoint

When [configuring webhooks](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/6103339-configure-a-webhook), you have the ability to configure a **test endpoint url** and an **endpoint url**.

### Test endpoint url

The test endpoint url is the endpoint we will send events to when **previewing** the pathway. The pathway preview is like a flight simulator for care pathway. It allows you to validate and test the pathways you have built and also your integrationâ€™s.

<Alert title="Manual triggering of webhooks when previewing" type="info">
  <p>Webhooks are not automatically sent to the test endpoint url when previewing a pathway. This is done to avoid unnecessary calling of your test endpoint. You can send webhooks manually by going to `Dashboard > Wehooks` and click on the webhook you would like to send to your test endpoint.</p>
</Alert>

### Production endpoint url

The (production) endpoint url is the endpoint we will send webhooks to when actually Orchestrating the care pathway. Webhooks are always sent automatically to the endpoint when Orchestrating care pathways.
