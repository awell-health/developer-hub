description: How webhooks are secured
---

We value security & privacy, especially because we're handling sensistive healthcare data. As a company, we're doing our best to stay ahead of attackers by fixing and guarding the loopholes in our systems.

Outlined below are the strategies we use to facilitate security when working with webhooks

### Digital signature

Webhooks are digitally signed using a 2048 bits RSA key specific to your account. The signature is generated from the webhook body and is included in a custom `x-awell-signature` header.

Here is how the signature can be verified in Node.js:
```typescript
import { createVerify } from 'crypto';
/**
 * Verify that the incoming webhook has been sent by Awell and has not been tampered with.
 * @param {any} body the JSON body of the webhook.
 * @param {string} signature the base64 encoded signature taken from the `x-awell-signature` header.
 * @param {string} publicKey your public signing key available in Awell Studio.
 * @returns true if the signature is valid
 */
const verifyWebhook = (body, signature, publicKey) => {
  const verify = createVerify('sha256').update(JSON.stringify(body)).end();
  return verify.verify(publicKey, Buffer.from(signature, 'base64'));
}
```

### Encryption (HTTPS)

We only allow HTTPS webhook endpoints. This provides security at the transport layer, ensuring that all data sent is encrypted and therefore cannot be read.

### Headers to verify the source

Headers can be configured for all outgoing webhooks that are sent by our system. An authentication token can thus be added to the header you can validate that token to verify whether the incoming request is coming from the right source.

### Whitelisting

Another way to verify the source is for you to be aware of our IP address. You can whitelist this IP address and bounce any other request coming from unknown IP addresses.
