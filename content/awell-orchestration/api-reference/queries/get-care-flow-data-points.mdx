## Request

Fetch data points from a care flow.

While the ID of the care flow (`pathway_id`) is mandatory, the `data_point_definition_id` and `activity_id` are optional.

### Query

```graphql
query GetPathwayDataPoints(
  $pathway_id: String!
  $data_point_definition_id: String
  $activity_id: String
) {
  pathwayDataPoints(
    pathway_id: $pathway_id
    data_point_definition_id: $data_point_definition_id
    activity_id: $activity_id
  ) {
    data_points {
      id
      data_set_id
      key
      serialized_value
      data_point_definition_id
      date
      valueType
      activity_id
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `pathway_id` | `String!` | The instance of the care flow to fetch data points from. |
| `data_point_definition_id` | `String` | The ID of the data point definition to filter the data points by. |
| `activity_id` | `String` | The ID of the activity to filter the data points by. |

### Use cases

#### Fetching all data points from a care flow
    
```json
{
    "pathway_id": "{{ PATHWAY_ID }}"
}
```

Fetch all data points from a care flow. These will be sorted by date in descending order, by default.

#### Fetch data points from a specific activity


```json
{
    "pathway_id": "my_pathway_id",
    "activity_id": "my_activity_id"
}
```
Another common use case would be to see all data points returned from a given activity (e.g. a form submission or an extension activity)

---

#### Fetch data points from a specific data point definition


```json
{
    "pathway_id": "my_pathway_id",
    "data_point_definition_id": "my_data_point_definition_id"
}
```

Finally, another use case would be to see all data points returned from a specific data point definition (e.g. a blood pressure measurement or a PROM, collected multiple times over a period of time)
