  }
}
```

## can_trigger_manually

This boolean field indicates that the track can be triggered manually using the [startTrack](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-track) or [scheduleTrack](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/schedule-track) mutations.

The `id` of the track is the track reference required for these mutations, and does not change between published pathway versions. You will also need the id of the specific patient pathway the track is (scheduled) to be added to.
