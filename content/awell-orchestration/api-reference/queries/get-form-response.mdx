## Request

### Query

```graphql
query GetFormResponse($pathway_id: String!, $activity_id: String!) {
  formResponse(pathway_id: $pathway_id, activity_id: $activity_id) {
    response {
      answers {
        question_id
        value
        value_type
        label
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Label is nullable as it is only applicable in case of Multi-Choice questions where each option is a combination of a Value and a Label.

### Variables

```json
{
  "pathway_id": "{{PATIENT_PATHWAY_ID}}",
  "activity_id": "{{FORM_ACTIVITY_ID}}"
}
