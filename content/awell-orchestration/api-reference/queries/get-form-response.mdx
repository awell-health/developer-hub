## Request

### Query

```graphql
query GetFormResponse($pathway_id: String!, $activity_id: String!) {
  formResponse(pathway_id: $pathway_id, activity_id: $activity_id) {
    response {
      answers {
        question_id
        value
        value_type
        label
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The `label` field may be empty (null) for non-multi-choice questions; for multi-choice questions, it represents the text description of the selected option, pairing its value with a descriptive label.

  "pathway_id": "{{PATIENT_PATHWAY_ID}}",
  "activity_id": "{{FORM_ACTIVITY_ID}}"
