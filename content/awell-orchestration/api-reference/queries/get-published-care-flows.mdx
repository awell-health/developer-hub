### Query

```graphql
query GetPublishedPathwayDefinitions {
  publishedPathwayDefinitions {
    publishedPathwayDefinitions {
      id
      title
      version
      data_point_definitions { # previously dataPointDefinitions
        id
        key
        category
        valueType
        optional
        range {
          min
          max
        }

          label
          value
        }
      }
      track_definitions {
        id
        title
        can_trigger_manually
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## The can_trigger_manually field

This boolean field indicates that the track can be triggered manually using the [startTrack](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-track) or [scheduleTrack](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/schedule-track) mutations.

The `id` of the track is the track reference required for these mutations, and does not change between published care flow versions. You will also need the id of the specific patient care flow the track is (scheduled) to be added to.
