title: Get data point definitions
description: Retrieve the data dictionary for a care flow
---

For any given care flow a patient is included in, you might want to know what data points are captured in that care flow (i.e a data dictionary). Via the `pathwayDataPointDefinitions` query, you're able to retrieve all data points definitions for a given care flow version.

## Release id

Every patient enrolled in a care flow is included in the last version of the care flow at the moment of care flow start. Because care flows can evolve over time, it might be that the oldest version of your care flow has a totally different data dictionary compared to the most recent version.

Therefore, to query all the data point definitions for a given care flow version, you need to specify the `release_id` as an input parameter for this query.

### Version vs. release id

The `version` of a care flow is an auto-incremented and human-readable numerical value (eg: version 5). However, every version also has a unique identifier which is called the `release_id`. The `version` and `release_id` are returned in all care flow related queries.

**Example:**
All patients included in version 5 of the care flow have the same `release_id`.

## Query

```graphql
query GetPathwayDataPointDefinitions(
  $release_id: String!
  $category: [String!]
  $value_type: [String!]
) {
  pathwayDataPointDefinitions(
    filters: { category: { in: $category }, value_type: { in: $value_type } }
    release_id: $release_id
  ) {
    data_point_definitions {
      id
      title
      key
      category
      valueType
      possibleValues {
        value
        label
      }
      range {
        min
        max
      }
      unit
      optional
      pii
      data_point_metadata {
        key
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `data_point_metadata` field can be used to retrieve additional information about a data point definition. This additional information can be configured in the Data Catalog section of Awell Studio, and a guide can be found in [the Awell knowledge base](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/6619338-configure-use-your-data-catalog).

## Variables

### Required parameters

A `release_id` needs to be specified in order to retrieve the data dictionary for a care flow.

```json
{
  "release_id": "{{ RELEASE_ID }}"
}
```

### Filters

The filter is optional: if you don't provide one, all data points with the specified `release_id` will be returned.

```graphql
query GetPathwayDataPointDefinitions($release_id: String!) {
  pathwayDataPointDefinitions(release_id: $release_id) {
    data_point_definitions {
      ...DataPointDefinition
    }
  }
}
```

All `in` filter type accepts a list of values and results in an `is any of` search criteria.

When specifying multiple filters, the resulting criteria is the conjuction of all filters.

```json
{
  "release_id": "{{ RELEASE_ID }}",
  "category": [
    "CALCULATION",
    "FORM",
    "PATIENT_PROFILE",
    "PATHWAY",
    "TRACK",
    "STEP"
  ],
  "value_type": ["BOOLEAN", "DATE", "NUMBER", "NUMBERS_ARRAY", "STRING"]
}
```

### Pagination and sorting

There is no pagination or sorting available for this query. All matching patient care flows will be returned.
