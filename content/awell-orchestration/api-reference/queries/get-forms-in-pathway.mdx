title: Get all forms in a published pathway
description: Get all the form definitions in a published pathway
---

This query allows us to fetch the form details for all form defintions in a published care flow/pathway. Want to learn more about how to display the form in your UI and conditionally show/hide the correct questions based on the response?

## All forms vs. forms that will be completed

Please note that this query returns all forms in a published care flow or pathway but that this doesn't necessarily mean that all these forms will be completed as that is dependent on the logic built into the care flow.

**See the example below:**

- There are 3 forms: Form A, B, and C.
- However, Form B is only activated when the subject is a male and Form C when the subject is a female
- The query will return all published forms in the care flow or pathway so Form A, B, and C but depending on the workflow some forms might never be completed.
