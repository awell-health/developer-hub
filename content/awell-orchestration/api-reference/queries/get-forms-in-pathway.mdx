title: Get all forms in a published pathway
description: Get all the form definitions in a published pathway
---

This query allows us to fetch the form details for all form defintions in a published care flow/pathway. Want to learn more about how to display the form in your UI and conditionally show/hide the correct questions based on the response?

## All forms vs. forms that will be completed

Please note that this query returns all forms in a published care flow or pathway but that this doesn't necessarily mean that all these forms will be completed as that is dependent on the logic built into the care flow.

**See the example below:**

- There are 3 forms: Form A, B, and C.
- However, Form B is only activated when the subject is a male and Form C when the subject is a female
- The query will return all published forms in the care flow or pathway so Form A, B, and C but depending on the workflow some forms might never be completed.

## Metadata

Form and question metadata is returned in all form queries as a JSON string rather than a JSON object. This is because the metadata is defined in Studio as a JSON string and we want to avoid any potential parsing errors. You can parse the metadata string into a JSON object in your application (for example, using `JSON.parse` in JavaScript/TypeScript, `json.loads` in Python or `json_decode` in PHP or Ruby).

## Request

### Query

```graphql
query GetFormsForPublishedPathway(
  $pathway_definition_id: String!
  $release_id: String
) {
  forms(
    pathway_definition_id: $pathway_definition_id
    release_id: $release_id
  ) {
    forms {
      id
      definition_id # static id from Studio
      title
      key # form key set in Studio
      metadata # JSON metadata string set in Studio
      questions {
        id
        definition_id # static id from Studio
        title # string or html string (for description questions)
        key # question key set in Studio
        dataPointValueType
        questionType
        metadata # JSON metadata string set in Studio
        options {
          id
          value
          label
        }
        rule {
          # visibility conditions of a question
          boolean_operator
          conditions {
            id
            reference # definition id of the question this condition is based on
            operator
            operand {
              type
              value
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

The `release_id` is optional. If not specified, we return the forms for the latest published version of the care flow or pathway.

```json
{
  "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
  "release_id": "{{PATHWAY_RELEASE_ID}}"
}
```
