description: Retrieve the audit logs for a care flow
---

Audit logs are detailed and comprehensible breadcrumbs providing a clear trail of all activities within your care flows and give insights into the precise moments and reasons behind the activation of tracks, steps, actions, and more.

## Request

### Query

```graphql
query GetAuditLogs(
  $filters: PathwayFactsFilters!
  $pagination: PaginationParams
  $sorting: SortingParams
) {
  pathwayFacts(filters: $filters, pagination: $pagination, sorting: $sorting) {
    code
    success
    facts {
      date
      level
      pathway_id
      content
    }
    pagination {
      offset
      count
      total_count
    }
    sorting {
      field
      direction
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

The `pathway_id` filter is the sole mandatory variable needed for the query to function.

Pagination and sorting parameters are provided for optional use. If not specified, pagination defaults to an offset of 0 and returns 10 records, while the sorting parameter is automatically set to arrange the audit logs in ascending order according to the date field.

#### Simple usage

Retrieve the first 10 audit logs for a given care flow in ascending order by date:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "pathway_id": "example-pathway-id"
  }
}
```

<br />

#### Advanced usage

Retrieve audit logs for a given care flow with keyword filtering, custom pagination, and sorting. The keyword filter searches within the content of the audit logs, returning entries that contain the specified string in any part of their content.

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "pathway_id": "example-pathway-id",
    "keyword": "track",
    "date": {
      "gte": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  "pagination": {
    "count": "20",
    "offset": "0"
  },
  "sorting": {
    "direction": "desc",
    "field": "date"
  }
}
```
