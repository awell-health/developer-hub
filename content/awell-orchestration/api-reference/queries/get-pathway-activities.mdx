title: Get pathway activities
description: Get all activities in a given pathway
---

This query lets us fetch all of the pathway activities of any status for a specific orchestrated pathway, including system activities such as calculations or activations.

> We suggest reading the page on our [domain model](/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/domain-model) first to get an understanding of the activity model.

## Request

### Query

```graphql
query GetPathwayActivities($pathway_id: String!) {
  pathwayActivities(pathway_id: $pathway_id) {
    success
    activities {
      id
      stream_id
      status
      date
      isUserActivity
      subject {
        type
        name
      }
      action
      object {
        id
        type
        name
      }
      indirect_object {
        id
        type
        name
      }
      # For form content
      form {
        ...Form
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "pathway_id": "{{ PATIENT_PATHWAY_ID }}"
  "pagination": { "offset": 0, "count": 500 } // optional
  "sorting": { "field": $sort_field, "direction": $sort_direction } // optional
}
```

### Pagination and sorting

Pagination and sorting are optional for this query. If no pagination values are supplied, the API will return only the first 100 activities. There is an upper limit of 500 records per query. Please be aware that setting `count` greater than 500 will throw an error.

Default sorting is based on the `date` field, in descending order (i.e. newest to oldest).

```graphql
query GetPathwayActivities(
  $pathway_id: String!, 
  $pagination: PaginationParams, 
  $sorting: SortingParams
  ) {
  pathwayActivities(
    pathway_id: $pathway_id, 
    pagination: $pagination, 
    sorting: $sorting
    ) {
      success
      activities {
        id
        stream_id
        status
        date
        isUserActivity
        subject {
          type
          name
        }
        action
        object {
          id
          type
          name
        }
        indirect_object {
          id
          type
          name
        }
        # For form content
        form {
          ...Form
        }
        pagination {
          count
          offset
          total_count
        }
        sorting {
          field
          direction
        }
    }
  }
}
```

## How to use

### Get all pending user activities

**An orchesrated care flow consists of system activities and user actionable activities (forms, messages, checklists, ...).** System activities are activities related to the Orchestration of the care flow whereas user actionable activities are the actual activities a stakeholder (eg: patient) needs to interact with.

In most cases, you're only interested in the user actionable activities which you can get by filtering the activities array by the `isUserActivity` field.

Additionally, you can filter the results by `status === 'ACTIVE'` to only get the pending activities.

<Alert type="info">
  <p>The query doesn't support server-side filtering yet so the filters have to be applied on the response of the query.</p>
</Alert>

### Filter activities by stakeholder

User actionable activities need to be completed by a certain stakeholder. The stakeholder who needs to complete an activity is determined by the stakeholder you assigned to an action in Awell Studio. To get all pending activities for a given stakeholder, you can filter on the `activity.indirect_object.type` and the `activity.indirect_object.name` field.

**Example:**<br/>
If you'd like to get all pending activities for the patient, you can filter the activities array by `activity.indirect_object.type === PATIENT`.

The table below can help you with filtering activities for the right stakeholder:

<div className="flex flex-col">
  <div className="-my-2 -mx-4 overflow-x-auto sm:-mx-6 lg:-mx-8">
    <div className="inline-block min-w-full py-2 align-middle md:px-6 lg:px-8">

            >
              Stakeholder type <br />
              (activity.indirect_object.type)

            <th scope="col" className="py-3.5 px-3 text-left">
              Stakeholder name <br />
              (activity.indirect_object.name)

### Including Form Content in Form Activities

To simplify obtaining the content of a form for a form activity, there are two options:

- as with all actions, you can use the `activity.object.id` and the related getter query (e.g. GetForm, GetMessage) to fetch the content you need
- expand this query by including the `form` field at the `activity` root (see `...Form` in the query above), along with the form fields you are interested in. The schema of a form is identical to what you would use in the [GetForm](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-form) query:

```graphql
form {
  id
  definition_id # static id from Studio
  title
  key # form key set in Studio
  metadata # JSON metadata string set in Studio
  questions {
    id
    definition_id # static id from Studio
    title # string or html string (for description questions)
    key # question key set in Studio
    dataPointValueType
    questionType
    metadata # JSON metadata string set in Studio
    options {
      id
      value
      label
    }
    rule {
      # visibility conditions of a question
      boolean_operator
      conditions {
        id
        reference # definition id of the question this condition is based on
        operator
        operand {
          type
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For non-Form activities, this field will return `null`. Currently, the `form` field is only available on this activity query.

Form and question metadata is returned in all form queries as a JSON string rather than a JSON object. This is because the metadata is defined in Studio as a JSON string and we want to avoid any potential parsing errors. You can parse the metadata string into a JSON object in your application (for example, using `JSON.parse` in JavaScript/TypeScript, `json.loads` in Python or `json_decode` in PHP or Ruby).

**Example:**<br/>
If you'd like to get all pending activities for the patient, you can filter the activities array by `activity.indirect_object.type === PATIENT`.
