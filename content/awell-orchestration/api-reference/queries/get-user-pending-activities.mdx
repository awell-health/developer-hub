title: Get a user's activities
description: Get all activities or pending activities for a given user over all care flows
---

**Two queries are available for user activities:**

1. `myPendingActivities`: Get all pending activities for a given user over all care flows.
2. `myActivities`: Get all activities (any status) for a given user, with optional filtering by pathway.

**If you'd like to fetch activities in a specific care flow**, use the [GetPathwayActivities query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-care-flow-activities).

> We suggest reading the page on our [domain model](/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/domain-model) first to get an understanding of the activity model.

## Request

### Headers

Use the `X-User-ID` header to specify for what user you'd like to fetch activities for. For example, you can pass the Awell patient ID as the value which will return all activities over all care flows the patient is included in.

We use the value of the `X-User-ID` header to find all activities where the value matches the `activity.indirect_object.id` field.

### Get pending activities

This query fetches a specific user's pending care flow activities (i.e., activities that require them to take action) **for all care flows they are involved in**. An activity is pending if its status is 'ACTIVE'.

**Query:**

```graphql
query GetPatientPendingActivities {
  myPendingActivities {
    code
    success
    activities {
      stream_id
      id
      status
      action
      date
      object {
        id
        type
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Get all user activities

Get all activities for a specific user across all care flows or filtered by a specific care flow. Supports pagination and sorting.

**Query:**

```graphql
query GetMyActivities(
  $pathway_id: String
  $pagination: PaginationParams
  $sorting: SortingParams
) {
  myActivities(
    pathway_id: $pathway_id
    pagination: $pagination
    sorting: $sorting
  ) {
    code
    success
    pagination {
      count
      offset
      total_count
    }
    sorting {
      field
      direction
    }
    activities {
      id
      stream_id
      date
      status
      action
      isUserActivity
      subject {
        id
        name
        type
      }
      object {
        id
        name
        type
      }
      indirect_object {
        id
        name
        type
      }
      context {
        instance_id
        pathway_id
        track_id
        step_id
        action_id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables:**

```json
{
  "pathway_id": "{{ PATHWAY_ID }}", // Optional: filter by specific care flow
  "pagination": {
    "count": 100,
    "offset": 0
  },
  "sorting": {
    "field": "date",
    "direction": "DESC"
  }
}
```
