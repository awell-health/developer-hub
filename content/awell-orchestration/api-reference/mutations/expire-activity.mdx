title: Expire activity
description: Manually expire an activity and mark it as skipped with a reason
---

This mutation allows you to manually expire an activity and mark it as skipped. When expiring an activity, you must provide a reason which will be recorded in the activity's history for audit and tracking purposes.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation ExpireActivity($input: ExpireActivityInput!) {
  expireActivity(input: $input) {
    success
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "input": {
    "activity_id": "{{ACTIVITY_ID}}",
    "user_id": "{{USER_ID}}",
    "user_email": "{{USER_EMAIL}}",
    "reason": "{{REASON_FOR_EXPIRING}}"
  }
}
```

## Required fields

- `activity_id`: The ID of the activity to expire
- `user_id`: The ID of the user who is expiring the activity
- `user_email`: The email address of the user (for audit trail)
- `reason`: A description explaining why the activity is being expired


## How it works

When you expire an activity:

1. The activity status is updated to expired with resolution "EXPIRED"
2. The user information is recorded in the audit trail
3. The care flow continues to the next steps, treating the activity as completed
4. The reason remains visible in the activity history for compliance and auditing

## Important notes

- Expired activities cannot be undone. Once an activity is expired, it is marked as completed and will not appear in pending activities.
- The reason provided is permanently recorded in the activity's history.
- Make sure to provide clear and descriptive reasons for expiring activities for future reference and compliance purposes.
