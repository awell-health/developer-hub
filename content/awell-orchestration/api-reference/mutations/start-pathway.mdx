## Selecting the version

When starting a pathway, Awell Orchestration automatically chooses the most recent published version of the specified pathway definition.

> Improved support for versioning is coming soon, with the ability to select a specific version when starting a new pathway and upgrading started pathways to newer version.

## Providing baseline data points

You have the ability to pass some initial data when starting a pathway with baseline data points. What data you can pass on pathway start needs to be configured in Awell Studio via the settings (see `Pathway > Settings > General`).

When your baseline data points are configured and your pathway is published, you can query the available baseline data points via the `publishedPathwayDefinitions` query (see documentation [here](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways)).

> There are `required` and `optional` baseline data points. A pathway will not be started until all required baseline data points have a value.

```graphql
query GetPublishedPathwayDefinitions {
  publishedPathwayDefinitions {
    publishedPathwayDefinitions {
      id
      title
      dataPointDefinitions {
        id
        key
        valueType
        optional
      }
    }
  }
}
```
