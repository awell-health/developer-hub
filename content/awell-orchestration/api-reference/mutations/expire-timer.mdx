title: Expire timer
description: Manually expire a timer activity before its scheduled completion time
---

This mutation allows you to manually expire a timer activity before it reaches its scheduled completion time. This is useful when you need to end a waiting period early or when certain conditions are met that make waiting for the timer unnecessary.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation ExpireTimer($input: ExpireTimerInput!) {
  expireTimer(input: $input) {
    success
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "input": {
    "activity_id": "{{TIMER_ACTIVITY_ID}}",
    "user_name": "{{USER_NAME}}"
  }
}
```

## Required fields

- `activity_id`: The ID of the timer activity to expire
- `user_name`: The name of the user who is expiring the timer (for audit purposes)

## Use cases

Timer activities are used in care flows to introduce waiting periods or delays. You might want to expire a timer early in scenarios such as:

- A patient completes a prerequisite action that makes waiting unnecessary
- Clinical conditions change requiring immediate action
- Administrative decisions to accelerate the care flow
- Testing and development workflows

## How it works

When you expire a timer:

1. The timer activity status is updated to completed
2. The care flow continues immediately without waiting for the scheduled timer completion
3. An audit log is created with the user information for tracking purposes
4. Any downstream activities scheduled after the timer will be triggered
