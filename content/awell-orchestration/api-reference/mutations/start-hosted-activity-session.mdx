title: Start hosted activity session
description: Create a session for a given stakeholder to complete activities via the Awell Hosted Activity page
---

This page documents the `startHostedActivitySession` mutation but we recommend reading ["What are Awell Hosted Pages"](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/what-are-awell-hosted-pages) page first and the [full guide](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/hosted-activity-guide) on how to set-up the Hosted Activity integration.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StartHostedActivitySession($input: StartHostedActivitySessionInput!) {
  startHostedActivitySession(input: $input) {
    session_id
    session_url
  }
}
```

### Required variables

`pathway_id` specifies the care flow/pathway instance where there are activities to complete for.

`stakeholder_id` specifies for what stakeholder there are activities to compelete for.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[3, 4]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_id": "{{PATHWAY_ID}}",
    "stakeholder_id": "{{STAKEHOLDER_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html"
  }
}
`}
</code>

### Optional variables

The `success_url` and `cancel_url` specify where the stakeholder should be redirected to when the care flow/pathway session is completed or canceled/interrupted respectively. If `success_url` and `cancel_url` are not specified, then static success and cancel pages will be shown in the Hosted Pages application.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[5, 7]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_id": "{{PATHWAY_ID}}",
    "stakeholder_id": "{{STAKEHOLDER_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html",
    "language": "en"
  }
}
`}
</code>

#### Language

You can specify the language you'd like the hosted pages app to be loaded in. If no language is passed, it defaults to English.

**Supported languages:**

Languages should be passed as an [ISO 639-1 shortcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

```json

## Session expiration

A session expires after 60 minutes but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a pathway.
