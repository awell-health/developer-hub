description: Create a new patient, anonymous patients are also supported.

## Deduplication

In order to make sure you there's only one single reference to each unique patient, we advise you to first search whether the patient already exists ([see "searchPatient" queries](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/search-patient)).

## Reconcile patient records

In order to establish a link between the patient resource on your end and the patient resource in Awell, we advise you to store the identifier of the patient resource in your system in the `patient_code` field. This way its easy to establish a link between the patient record in your system and in Awell's system.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation CreatePatient($input: CreatePatientInput!) {
  createPatient(input: $input) {
    patient {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables for anonymous patient

In case you want to create anonymous patients without any PHI, we still advise you to specify a `patient_code` where you can insert the internal identifier of the patient. This can later be used to reconcile the Awell patient resource with a patient resource in your system.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "patient_code": "{{YOUR_INTERNAL_PATIENT_IDENTIFIER}}" // recommended
  }
}
```

### Variables for patient with profile data

Use our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/awell-orchestration/developer-tools/api/playground">GraphQL explorer</a> to discover all the variables you can pass with this mutation.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "patient_code": "{{YOUR_INTERNAL_PATIENT_IDENTIFIER}}",
    "first_name": "{{PATIENT_FIRST_NAME}}",
    "last_name": "{{PATIENT_LAST_NAME}}"
  }
}
```

## Validation

### Preferred language

Languages should be passed as an [ISO 639-1 shortcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

```json
{
  "input": {
    "preferred_language": "en"
  }
}
```

### Phone numbers

Phone numbers should be passed in the E.164 format. Read more [here](/awell-orchestration/developer-tools/api/e164-phone-validation).

```json
{
  "input": {
    "mobile_phone": "+16175551212",
    "phone": "+16175551212" // Landline
  }
}
```
