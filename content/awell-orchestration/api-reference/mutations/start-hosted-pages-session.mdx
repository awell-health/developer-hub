title: Start Hosted Pages session
description: Create a session for a specific stakeholder to complete activities in a care flow with Hosted Pages
---

We recommend reading more about ["Awell Hosted Pages"](/awell-orchestration/docs/awell-hosted-pages/overview-hosted-pages) first before moving on.

Please note that this mutation can only be used to create a Hosted Pages session for a care flow that is already active. Have a look at our [Start pathway and Hosted Pages session mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-pathway-and-hosted-pages-session). If you would like to start a pathway and immediately create a session.

## Lifecycle

1. When Awell notifies you via the `activity.created` webhook or through a specific action in the care flow, such as an API call, indicating that a patient/stakeholder needs to complete an activity in a care flow, your application creates a new Hosted Pages Session with this mutation. **This will will give you access to a session URL**.
2. You embed (or redirect staeholder to) Hosted Pages as an iframe in your app so the patient can interact with their pending activities.
3. The patient completes all their pending activities.
4. (optional) When all pending activities are completed, you can subscribe to the `session.completed` webhook to trigger any kind of post-completion logic on your end ([view all session-related webhooks](/awell-orchestration/docs/data/webhooks-and-events)).

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StartHostedPagesSession($input: StartHostedPagesSessionInput!) {
  startHostedActivitySession(input: $input) {
    session_id
    session_url
  }
}
```

### Required variables

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[3, 4]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_id": "{{PATHWAY_ID}}",
    "stakeholder_id": "{{STAKEHOLDER_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html"
  }
}
`}
</code>

The `pathway_id` specifies which care flow/pathway instance there are activities to complete for and the `stakeholder_id` specifies the stakeholder.

### Optional variables

The `success_url` and `cancel_url` specify where the stakeholder should be redirected to when the care flow/pathway session is completed or canceled/interrupted respectively. If `success_url` and `cancel_url` are not specified, then static success and cancel pages will be shown in the Hosted Pages application.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[5, 7]]}>

  "input": {
    "pathway_id": "{{PATHWAY_ID}}",

## Session expiration

A session expires after 60 minutes but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a pathway.
