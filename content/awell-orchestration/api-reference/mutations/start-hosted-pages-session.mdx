title: Start Hosted Pages session
description: Create a session for a specific stakeholder to complete activities in a care flow with Hosted Pages
---

We recommend reading more about ["Awell Hosted Pages"](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/overview-hosted-pages) first before moving on.

Please note that this mutation can only be used to create a Hosted Pages session for a care flow that is already active. Have a look at our [Start Hosted Pages session mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-hosted-pages-session) If you would like to start a pathway or care flow and immediately create a session

This mutation starts a pathway or care flow first and immediately creates a session for the patient stakeholder. If you want to create a Hosted Pages session for an ongoing pathway or care flow, have a look at the [Start Hosted Pages session mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-hosted-pages-session).

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StartHostedPagesSession($input: StartHostedPagesSessionInput!) {
  startHostedActivitySession(input: $input) {
    session_id
    session_url
  }
}
```

### Required variables

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[3, 4]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_id": "{{PATHWAY_ID}}",
    "stakeholder_id": "{{STAKEHOLDER_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html"
  }
}
`}
</code>

The `pathway_id` specifies which care flow/pathway instance there are activities to complete for and the `stakeholder_id` specifies the stakeholder.

### Optional variables

The `success_url` and `cancel_url` specify where the stakeholder should be redirected to when the care flow/pathway session is completed or canceled/interrupted respectively. If `success_url` and `cancel_url` are not specified, then static success and cancel pages will be shown in the Hosted Pages application.

A session expires after 60 minutes but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a pathway.
