title: Stop track
description: Stop a track in a patient care flow (pathway)
---

Any track in a patient care flow (pathway) can be stopped. This will stop the orchestration of the track and no notifications (eg reminders) will be sent anymore. The track will come to a halt at the state it's currently in and an activity will be generated indicating that the track was stopped.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StopTrack($input: StopTrackInput!) {
  stopTrack(input: $input) {
    success
  }
}
```

### Variables

The `pathway_id` is the id of the patient care flow (pathway) for which you want to stop a track. The `track_id` is the id of the track that you want to stop.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_id": "{{PATHWAY_ID}}",
    "track_id": "{{TRACK_ID}}" // obtainable from the track activated activity (activity.context.instance_id)
  }
}
```

## Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "stopTrack": {
      "success": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Errors

The following errors can be returned:

- `ORCHESTRATION_ACTIVITY_ERROR`: "An error occurred when creating a `track stopped` activity" -> This occurs when there is an error generating the track stopped activity. This activity is generated after a track has been stopped so it is not critical to the functionality of the track being stopped.
- `NOT_FOUND`: "Element XXXX not found" -> This occurs if the track to be stopped cannot be found
- `BAD_REQUEST_ERROR`: "Element XXXXX has invalid status (XXXXX). Only active elements can be stopped." -> This occurs if the track you are trying to stop is not active (i.e. has already been stopped, discarded or completed)
