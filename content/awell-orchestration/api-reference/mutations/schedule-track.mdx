title: Schedule track
description: Schedule a track in a patient pathway
---

Any track configured to be manually triggered in a patient pathway can be scheduled for a date in the future. Scheduling a track in the past will cause it to be added to the care flow immediately.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation ScheduleTrack($input: ScheduleTrackInput!) {
  scheduleTrack(input: $input) {
    success
  }
}
```

### Variables

The `pathway_id` is the id of the patient pathway for which you want to stop a track. Any query that returns a patient pathway such as [patientPathways](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-patient-pathways) or [pathways](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-pathways), will return a pathway id.

The `track_id` is the id of the track that you want to stop. You can see a list of of schedulable tracks by using the [adHocTracks](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-ad-hoc-tracks) query.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_id": "{{PATHWAY_ID}}",
    "track_id": "{{TRACK_ID}}",
    "scheduled_date": "{{SCHEDULED_DATE}}", // ISO string date e.g. 2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
    "cancel_any_scheduled": true // optional, defaults to false
  }
}
```

#### cancel_any_scheduled

`cancel_any_scheduled` is an optional convenience argument that is useful for when a specific track definition should only ever have one pending instance for a given pathway.

By setting `cancel_any_scheduled` to be true, you can freely use the `scheduleTrack` mutation without needing to manage any previously scheduled instance(s). Any scheduled tracks _of this definition_ will be canceled and replaced with a new scheduled instance.

Note that `cancel_any_scheduled` set to true only cancels previous instances of the specified track definition. If you wish to cancel all scheduled tracks for a pathway when there are multiple track definitions, you can use the [cancelScheduledTracks](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/cancel-scheduled-tracks) mutation after fetching all scheduled track ids with [scheduledTracks](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-scheduled-tracks).

## Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "scheduleTrack": {
      "success": true,
      "id": "<<SCHEDULED_TRACK_ID>>" // can be used to cancel the scheduled track
    }
  }
}
```
