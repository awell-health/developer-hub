description: Schedule a track in a patient care flow (pathway)

Any track configured to be manually triggered in a patient care flow (pathway) can be scheduled for a date in the future. Scheduling a track in the past will cause it to be added to the care flow immediately.

  scheduleTrack(input: $input) {

}
```

  "input": {
    "pathway_id": "{{PATHWAY_ID}}",
    "track_id": "{{TRACK_ID}}",
