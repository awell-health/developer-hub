title: Start hosted pathway session
description: Start a pathway and create a session to redirect to the Awell Hosted Pathway page
---

This page documents the `startHostedPathwaySession` mutation but we recommend reading the ["What are Awell Hosted Pages"](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/what-are-awell-hosted-pages) page first and the [full guide](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/hosted-pathway-guide) on how to get started with Awell in less than a day via the Awell Hosted Pathway integration.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StartHostedPathwaySession($input: StartHostedPathwaySessionInput!) {
  startHostedPathwaySession(input: $input) {
    session_id
    session_url
    pathway_id
    stakeholder {
      id
      type
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Required variables

`pathway_definition_id` specifies what pathway definition needs to be started.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[3, 3]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html"
  }
}
`}
</code>

### Optional variables

The `success_url` and `cancel_url` specify where the stakeholder should be redirected to when the care flow/pathway session is completed or canceled/interrupted respectively. If `success_url` and `cancel_url` are not specified, then static success and cancel pages will be shown in the Hosted Pages application.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[4, 8]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html",
    "patient_id": "{{PATIENT_ID}}",
    "data_points": [],
    "language": "ENGLISH"
  }
}
`}
</code>
<br />

#### Language

You can specify the language you'd like the hosted pages app to be loaded in. If no language is passed, it defaults to English.

Languages should be passed as an [ISO 639-1 shortcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

```json
{
  "input": {
    "language": "nl" | "en" | "de" | "et",
  }
}
```

<br />

#### Patient id

Every pathway is linked to a patient resource in our system. We automatically create an anonymous patient resource if `patient_id` is left blank.

If you want to create a patient first, you will have to do an a priori API call to create the patient and use the id returned by that API call as the value for the `patient_id` field. See the [createPatient mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/create-patient) for more information on how to create a patient.

#### Data points (or Baseline info)

You have the ability to pass some initial data when starting a pathway. What data you can pass on pathway start needs to be configured in Awell Studio via the settings (see `Pathway > Settings > General`).

When your baseline data points are configured and your pathway is published, you can query the available baseline data points via the [publishedPathwayDefinitions query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways).

> There are `required` and `optional` baseline data points. A pathway will not be started until all required baseline data points have a value.

Passing baseline info is as easy as providing an array of objects in the following format

```json
{
  "data_points": [
    {
      "data_point_definition_id": "{{DATA_POINT_DEFINITION_ID}}",
      "value": "{{DATA_POINT_VALUE}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Session expiration

A session expires after 60 minutes but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a pathway.
