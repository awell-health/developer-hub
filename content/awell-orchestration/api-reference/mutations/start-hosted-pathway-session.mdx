title: Start hosted pathway session
description: Start a pathway and create a session to redirect to the Awell Hosted Pathway page
---

This page documents the `startHostedPathwaySession` mutation but we recommend reading the ["What are Awell Hosted Pages"](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/what-are-awell-hosted-pages) page first and the [full guide](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/hosted-pathway-guide) on how to get started with Awell in less than a day via the Awell Hosted Pathway integration.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StartHostedPathwaySession($input: StartHostedPathwaySessionInput!) {
  startHostedPathwaySession(input: $input) {
    session_id
    session_url
    pathway_id
    stakeholder {
      id
      type
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Required variables

`pathway_definition_id` specifies what pathway definition needs to be started.

The `success_url` and `cancel_url` specify where the user should be redirected to when the pathway session is completed or canceled/interrupted respectively.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[3, 5]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html"
  }
}
`}
</code>

### Optional variables

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[6, 8]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html",
    "patient_id": "{{PATIENT_ID}}",
    "data_points": [],
    "language": "ENGLISH"
  }
}
`}
</code>
<br />

#### Language

You can specify the language you'd like the hosted pages app to be loaded in. If no language is passed, it defaults to English.

**Supported languages:**

<div className="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Language</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>English</td>
        <td>ENGLISH</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Dutch</td>
        <td>DUTCH</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>French</td>
        <td>FRENCH</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Estonian</td>
        <td>ESTONIAN</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<br />

#### Patient id

Every pathway is linked to a patient resource in our system. We automatically create an anonymous patient resource if `patient_id` is left blank.

If you want to create a patient first, you will have to do an a priori API call to create the patient and use the id returned by that API call as the value for the `patient_id` field. See the [createPatient mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/create-patient) for more information on how to create a patient.

#### Data points (or Baseline info)

You have the ability to pass some initial data when starting a pathway. What data you can pass on pathway start needs to be configured in Awell Studio via the settings (see `Pathway > Settings > General`).

When your baseline data points are configured and your pathway is published, you can query the available baseline data points via the [publishedPathwayDefinitions query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways).

> There are `required` and `optional` baseline data points. A pathway will not be started until all required baseline data points have a value.

Passing baseline info is as easy as providing an array of objects in the following format

```json
{
  "data_points": [
    {
      "data_point_definition_id": "{{DATA_POINT_DEFINITION_ID}}",
      "value": "{{DATA_POINT_VALUE}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Session expiration

A session expires after 60 minutes but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a pathway.
