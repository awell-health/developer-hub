title: Submit checklist response
description: Submit a completed checklist
---

This request allows us to complete a checklist. We do not track the completion of individual checklist items, only that the checklist has been completed so that we can continue orchestrating the care flow.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation SubmitChecklist($input: SubmitChecklistInput!) {
  submitChecklist(input: $input) {
    activity {
      id
      status
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
    "input": {
        "activity_id": {{CHECKLIST_ID}}
    }
}
```

### Specifying the user

The optional `X-User-ID` header can be used to specify which user has completed the checklist. When this header is present, Awell Orchestration will log a subactivity indicating that this specific user completed the checklist.

```json
{
  "X-User-ID": "{{USER_ID}}"
}
```

The following input fields are available:

<div className="table-wrapper">
  <table>

      <tr>
        <th>Field</th>
