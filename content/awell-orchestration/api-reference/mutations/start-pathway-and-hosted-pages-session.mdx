title: Start pathway and Hosted Pages session
description: Start a pathway and create a session for Hosted Pages
---

We recommend reading more about ["Awell Hosted Pages"](/awell-orchestration/docs/interact-with-care-flows/awell-hosted-pages/overview-hosted-pages) first before moving on.

**This mutation starts a pathway or care flow first and immediately creates a session for the patient stakeholder.** If you want to create a Hosted Pages session for an ongoing pathway, have a look at the [Start Hosted Pages session mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-hosted-pages-session).

## Use cases

There are use cases, like onboarding and intake flows, where you might want a stakeholder (e.g. a patient) to start a care flow themselves and immediately let them complete activities in their care flows.

**Example**: a patient visits your website and there's a button to start an onboarding flow. Clicking the button should both start a care flow and immediately allow the patient to complete activities in that care flow.

## Request

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StartHostedPathwaySession($input: StartHostedPathwaySessionInput!) {
  startHostedPathwaySession(input: $input) {
    session_id
    session_url
    pathway_id
    stakeholder {
      id
      type
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Required variables

`pathway_definition_id` specifies what pathway definition needs to be started.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}"
  }
}
`}
```

### Optional variables

#### Patient

Every careflow is linked to a patient in Awell. Patients are uniquely identified in Awell by their Awell patient ID and the (business) identifier systems you configured in your tenant. Learn more about identifiers [here](/awell-orchestration/docs/misc/patient-identifiers).

You can pass in `patient_id` (Awell patient ID) or `patient_identifier` (business identifier) to start a care flow for an existing patient. If both are passed in, only `patient_id` will be used.

**When you are passing the Awell patient ID:**

```json
  {`
    {
      "input": {
        "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
        "patient_id": "{{AWELL_PATIENT_ID}}"
      }
    }
```

**When you are passing a business identifier:**

```json
  {`
    {
      "input": {
        "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
        "patient_identifier": {
          "system": "{{IDENTIFIER_SYSTEM}}",
          "value": "{{IDENTIFIER_VALUE}}"
        }
      }
    }
```

If no `patient_id` or `patient_identifier` is provided, we create an anonymous patient. Have a look at the [createPatient mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/create-patient) if you don't have a patient created yet and need to create one first.

#### Data points (baseline info)

You have the ability to pass some initial data when starting a pathway. What data you can pass on pathway start needs to be configured in Awell Studio via the settings (see `Pathway > Settings > General`).

When your baseline data points are configured and your pathway is published, you can query the available baseline data points via the [publishedPathwayDefinitions query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways).

> There are `required` and `optional` baseline data points. A pathway will not be started until all required baseline data points have a value.

**Passing baseline info is as easy as providing an array of objects in the following format:**

```json
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "data_points": [
      {
        "data_point_definition_id": "{{DATA_POINT_DEFINITION_ID}}",
        "value": "{{DATA_POINT_VALUE}}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<br />

#### Success and cancel URL

The `success_url` and `cancel_url` specify where the stakeholder should be redirected to when the care flow/pathway session is completed or canceled/interrupted respectively. If `success_url` and `cancel_url` are not specified, then static success and cancel pages will be shown in the Hosted Pages application.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html"
  }
}
```
<br />

#### Language

Languages should be passed as an [ISO 639-1 shortcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).If no language is passed, it defaults to English.

```
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```

**Awell Hosted Pages is currently available in the following languages:**

- English (en)
- Dutch (nl)
- Estonian (et)
- French (fr)
- Romanian (ro)

## Session expiration

A session expires after 60 minutes but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a pathway.
