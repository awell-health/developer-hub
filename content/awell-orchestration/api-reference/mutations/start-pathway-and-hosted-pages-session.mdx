title: Start pathway and Hosted Pages session
description: Start a pathway and create a session for Hosted Pages
---

We recommend reading more about ["Awell Hosted Pages"](/awell-orchestration/docs/interact-with-care-flows/awell-hosted-pages/overview-hosted-pages) first before moving on.

**This mutation starts a pathway or care flow first and immediately creates a session for the patient stakeholder.** If you want to create a Hosted Pages session for an ongoing pathway or care flow, have a look at the [Start Hosted Pages session mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-hosted-pages-session).

## Use cases

There are use cases, like onboarding and intake flows, where you might want a stakeholder (e.g. a patient) to start a care flow themselves and immediately let them complete activities in their care flows.

**Example**: a patient visits your website and there's a button to start an onboarding flow. Clicking the button should both start a care flow and immediately allow the patient to complete activities in that care flow.

### Mutation

```graphql
mutation StartHostedPathwaySession($input: StartHostedPathwaySessionInput!) {
  startHostedPathwaySession(input: $input) {
    session_id
    session_url
    pathway_id
    stakeholder {
      id
      type
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Required variables

`pathway_definition_id` specifies what pathway definition needs to be started.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[3, 3]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html"
  }
}
`}
</code>

### Optional variables

The `success_url` and `cancel_url` specify where the stakeholder should be redirected to when the care flow/pathway session is completed or canceled/interrupted respectively. If `success_url` and `cancel_url` are not specified, then static success and cancel pages will be shown in the Hosted Pages application.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[4, 12]]}>
  {`
{
  "input": {
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/success.html",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourdomain.com/cancel.html",
    "patient_id": "{{PATIENT_ID}}",
    "patient_identifier": {
      "system": "{{IDENTIFIER_SYSTEM}}",
      "value": "{{IDENTIFIER_VALUE}}"
    },
    "data_points": [],
    "language": "en"
  }
}
`}
</code>

#### Language

Languages should be passed as an [ISO 639-1 shortcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).If no language is passed, it defaults to English.

**Awell Hosted Pages is currently available in the following languages:**

- English (en)
- Dutch (nl)
- Estonian (et)
- French (fr)
- Romanian (ro)

#### Patient id

Every pathway is linked to a patient in Awell. We automatically create an anonymous patient if `patient_id` is left blank.

If you want to create a patient first, you will have to do an a prior API call to create the patient and use the id returned by that API call as the value for the `patient_id` field. See the [createPatient mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/create-patient) for more information on how to create a patient.

#### Patient identifier

If you would like to create a new patient with a specific identifier or start a pathway for an existing patient you can pass patient identifier. Learn more about [identifiers](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/docs/misc/patient-identifiers).


#### Data points (or Baseline info)

You have the ability to pass some initial data when starting a pathway. What data you can pass on pathway start needs to be configured in Awell Studio via the settings (see `Pathway > Settings > General`).

When your baseline data points are configured and your pathway is published, you can query the available baseline data points via the [publishedPathwayDefinitions query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways).

> There are `required` and `optional` baseline data points. A pathway will not be started until all required baseline data points have a value.

Passing baseline info is as easy as providing an array of objects in the following format

```json
{
  "data_points": [
    {
      "data_point_definition_id": "{{DATA_POINT_DEFINITION_ID}}",
      "value": "{{DATA_POINT_VALUE}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Session expiration

A session expires after 60 minutes but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a pathway.
