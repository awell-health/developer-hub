## Care flow

### Set Live

Make sure your care flow is published and set live. A care flow in status 'draft' or 'published' cannot be orchestrated.

### API call actions

If you're using API call actions in your care flows, make sure they are configured to call the production endpoint.

**Tip:** Use [constants](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/6671868-constants-keep-your-static-data-clean) to store parameters like endpoint URLs and API keys to quickly substitute them in all your actions and keep everything nice and clean. 

### Extensions

Similarly to the API call action, will you want to swap the extension settings (e.g. URLs, API keys) to point to the right production environments.

## Integrations

### Environments

- Make sure to call the [production environment](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/api-reference/overview/endpoints) with an API key associated to the production environment.

### Outgoing webhooks

- Configure the webhook endpoints to call a production-ready endpoint (see [testing webhooks](/awell-orchestration/developer-tools/webhooks/test-webhooks) and [go live](/awell-orchestration/developer-tools/webhooks/go-live))

## Data

- [Rename your question keys](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/4815388-encode-questions-and-answer-options) to something consistent that is not verbose but captures the semantic meaning of the information collected.

## Testing

- Validate your care flow with the preview by creating cases
- Test your live flow in Orchestration with a test patient
