description: Let stakeholders start care flows simply by clicking or sharing a link
---

**Awell can generate a unique URL for your published care flow that, upon clicking, starts a care flow** and immediately returns a session URL to [Awell Hosted Pages](/awell-orchestration/docs/awell-hosted-pages/overview-hosted-pages) so the stakeholder who clicked the link can immediately interact with their activities.

## When to use

This trigger is perfect when:

1. You want stakeholders (usually the patient) to self-enroll. E.g. start an intake or onboarding flow upon clicking a button on your website or in your app.
2. Since a stakeholder/user initiates the trigger by clicking a link, there will be an instant feedback mechanism. This allows [Hosted Pages](/awell-orchestration/docs/awell-hosted-pages/overview-hosted-pages) to be displayed immediately to the user, enabling them to immediately complete their activities.

## How to

### Hosted Pages Link

In Awell Studio, you can easily generate a Sharing Link for your care flow. Learn more [here](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/8205067-hosted-pages-settings#h_ff100e8431).

### Session

You can use [this mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-pathway-and-hosted-pages-session) to programmatically start a care flow and immediately create a session with just a single API call.

The idea is that you call this mutation upon a user clicking a button or link. The mutation will return a `session_url` you can redirect the user to.
