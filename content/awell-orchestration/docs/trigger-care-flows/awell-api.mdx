description: Trigger care flows by calling Awell's API
---

**Triggering care flows through our API is the most flexible integration method, offering extensive versatility and catering to a broad range of use cases.** However, it's important to remember that setting this up typically requires technical expertise, so you'll likely need to allocate engineering resources to set up the integration.

## How to

Starting a care flow requires you to do the following sequence of API calls.

**Relevant documentation:**

1. [Start a pathway](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-pathway)
2. [Search a patient](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/search-patient)
3. [Create patient](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/create-patient)

For optimal system performance these calls need to be executed sequentially, i.e. start the next flow when response for previous one is received.
