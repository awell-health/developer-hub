description: Trigger care flows with Awell Care
---

**Awell Care is the application built, maintained, and provided by Awell that allows you to orchestrate and operate care flows you have designed in Awell Studio.** While most of our customers opt for a headless approach to Orchestration, using Awell Care is an option for those who would like to get started with a pre-built interface.

## How to

Triggering a care flow with Awell Care is straightforward: just use our interface to create a patient and start a care flow.

### Create patient

Create a patient in Awell Care.

## Use cases

- If you don't have a proprietary provider-facing app or are counting on Awell for providing the interface.
- Perfect for testing your care flows because you can easily switch between designing (Awell Studio) and orchestrating care flows (Awell Care).
