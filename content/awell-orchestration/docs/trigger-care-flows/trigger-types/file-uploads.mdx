description: Trigger care flows simply by uploading a file
---

A convenient way to get care flows started in Awell with maximum control but requiring practically no engineering lift is by uploading files via Awellâ€™s FTP Connector. Moreover, file upload a enables you to conveniently trigger multiple care flows in a batch.

## How it works

1. Awell provisions a secure FTP server for you and will provide the necessary login credentials for access.
2. You can upload CSV files (or similar data format files) in a format agreed upfront to the FTP server.
3. Awell polls the contents of the FTP server periodically (e.g. every hour). Upon detecting a new file, Awell will process it and start the required care flows.
4. Awell will manage the intricate tasks of verifying the existence of the patient in the system, creating a new patient record if needed, and starting the care flow.
5. For auditability, Awell maintains comprehensive logging.

**This approach offers an ideal balance:** you have complete control over the care flows you wish to start, with the simple action of uploading a file to an FTP server being enough to set it in motion ðŸª„.

### File format

The file format will be agreed upon upfront. Each row or entry in the file corresponds to a care flow that will be started.

## Use cases

Extract a CSV file of eligible patients from your systems and start all of them in one go.
