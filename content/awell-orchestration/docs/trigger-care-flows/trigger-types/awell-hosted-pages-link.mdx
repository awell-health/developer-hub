title: Awell Hosted Pages Link
description: Let patients and care team members start care flows simply by clicking a link
---

**Awell can generate a shareable link for your published care flow that, upon clicking, starts a care flow** and immediately returns a session URL to [Awell Hosted Pages](/awell-orchestration/docs/interact-with-care-flows/awell-hosted-pages/overview-hosted-pages) so the user who clicked the link can immediately interact with their activities.

This trigger is perfect when:

1. You want patients to be able to self-enroll in a care flow. E.g. start an intake or onboarding flow upon clicking a button on your website or in your app.
2. Since a patient initiates the trigger by clicking a link, there will be an instant feedback mechanism where [Hosted Pages](/awell-orchestration/docs/interact-with-care-flows/awell-hosted-pages/overview-hosted-pages) will be displayed to the user, enabling them to immediately complete their activities.

## How to

### Hosted Pages Link

In Awell Studio, you can generate a shareable Hosted Pages Link which, upon clicking, starts a care flow and navigates the user who clicked the link to Awell Hosted Pages. Learn more [here](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/8205067-hosted-pages-settings#h_ff100e8431).

**The link can also be downloaded as a QR code.** Patients can start a care flow easily by scanning the code using their mobile device.

### Session

You can use [this mutation](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-pathway-and-hosted-pages-session) to programmatically start a care flow and immediately create a session with just a single API call.

The concept is to invoke this mutation when a user clicks a button or link. This mutation will then provide a `session_url` to which you can redirect the user.
