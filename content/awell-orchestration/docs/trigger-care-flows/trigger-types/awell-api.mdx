**Triggering care flows through our API is the most flexible integration method, offering extensive versatility and catering to a broad range of use cases.** However, it's important to remember that setting this up typically requires technical expertise, so you'll likely need to allocate engineering resources to set up the integration.

## How to

Starting a care flow requires you to do the following sequence of API calls.
