title: Incoming webhook
description: Trigger care flows based on data and events in 3rd party systems
---

This trigger type allows you to use webhooks to start care flows when you receive data from an external system. Webhooks are perfect for real-time notifications and for using events in 3rd party systems to trigger care flows in Awell.

## How to

In Home also known as CareOps, navigate to Settings and then Incoming webhooks tab where you can set up your Incoming Webhooks.

### How to create new incoming webhook

1. Click `Create webhook`
2. Name your webhook and select which care flow you want it to trigger - make sure your care flow is published first

You are able to pass baseline data points into the webhook. If you do not require baseline data points you can enable the webhook and start using it.

If you do require baseline data points they will be displayed on the page for you to configure. 

### How to map the baseline data points

    <a
      href=" "
      target="_blank"
      title="Baseline Data Points"
    >
      <img
        src=" "
        alt="Baseline Data Points"
      />
    </a>

**The webhook will not trigger a care flow if you do not configure required baseline data points.** You can still send requests but they will be rejected.

1. Click `Create webhook`.
2. Name your webhook and select the care flow you want it to trigger (ensure the care flow is published).
3. Within a minute the payload will display on the page. Then start typing `$` on the data point which you want to map
4. A helper mapper will pop up with instructions on how to map and which element you are mapping from
5. Once you map all the baseline data points you want to pass to the incoming webhook send another test payload
6. We will run validation and display whether the mapping is correct and would indeed start a care flow
7. After successful validation, you can safely enable the incoming webhook.

### How to examine Incoming Webhook logs

1. Click `View logs`.
2. Select your filters (request status, incoming webhook name, and care flow name).
3. To examine the payload, click `View details` to navigate to the page displaying the request payload and status.

### Incoming Webhook log statuses

Available statuses: 

- **SCHEDULED**: The payload has all required baseline data points, and the request is queued for processing.
- **REJECTED**: Something is wrong with the payload or the incoming webhook is disabled; we reject the request.
- **TEST**: Test payload; we validated it, and if the response would have been rejected, we display why.
- **PROCESSING**: The scheduled request is being processed.
- **SUCCESS**: The care flow has been triggered correctly; we include the care flow ID and patient ID.
- **FAILED**: The request has failed during processing.

A successful request undergoes three statuses: SCHEDULED, PROCESSING, and SUCCESS. In the 'View details' page, you can access all pertinent logs associated with a specific request.
