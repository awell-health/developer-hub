title: ADT feeds
description: Trigger care flows based on a stream of ADT messages
---

**An "ADT feed" refers to an "Admission, Discharge, and Transfer" feed in the context of healthcare information systems.** ADT is a standard communication protocol used in the medical field to share patient status updates among different systems.

An ADT feed streams various types of messages related to the movements and changes in the status of a patient within a healthcare facility. The ADT feed is essential for keeping all parts of the healthcare system informed in real-time about where a patient is.

## How it works

**We use Mirth Connect (Mirth) as an integration engine to handle ADT feeds** (read more in ["Healthcare interopability"](http://localhost:3000/awell-orchestration/docs/data/healthcare-interoperability)). Mirth is configured to intercept your ADT messages and upon receiving a message, we process it, extracting key patient information and identifying which care flow to start.

## Use cases

Start, update, or delete a care flow based on messages from your hospital's scheduling system
