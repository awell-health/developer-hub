Awell Hosted Pages is a low-code integration allowing your patients and other stakeholders to interact with care flow activities like filling forms and reading messages. You can embed Hosted Pages directly in your website or redirect users to an Awell-hosted page. **It is the quickest way to get started with Awell.**

## Stripe analogy

When you are looking to implement payments into your application, chances are high you will consider using a platform like Stripe to collect payments from your users.

To collect a payment from a user, you will need to have some kind of payment page where the user can see the amount they need to pay and enter their payment details. You can do this by building a completly custom payment page on top of Stripe's API or you can leverage [Stripe's Prebuilt Checkout Page](https://stripe.com/en-gb-be/payments/checkout).
