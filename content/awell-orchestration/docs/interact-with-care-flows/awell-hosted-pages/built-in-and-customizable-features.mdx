---

Hosted Pages is designed and implemented to be simple, easy-to-use, customizable, and accessible.

## Accessibility

**Accessibility is important for web applications because it ensures that people with disabilities or impairments can use and access the web applications just like everyone else.** At Awell, we highly value inclusivity and usability of Hosted Pages as it is a user-facing solution. Improving the accessibility to make sure Hosted Pages can serve a wide range of the population is therefore an ongoing effort.

## Built-in

### Internationalization

Hosted Pages has built-in support for internationalization. The UI like buttons, loading indicators, etc can be served in the language of the user. Support for additional languages can easily be added.

### Simple design

No bells and whistles, Hosted Pages has been designed to be as simple as possible for the end user so they can easily complete their care flow activities.

### Optimized for any device

Hosted Pages is a responsive web app which provides an optimal experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### Keyboard navigation

[Keyboard accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/) is one of the most important aspects of web accessibility. Many users with motor disabilities rely on a keyboard.

## Customizable

### Branding

Customize Hosted Pages' accent color, logo, and page title to match the look and feel of your brand. This makes sure your users have a seemless experience across the board.

When setting a custom accent color, all UI components will automatically be rebranded based on that accent color. We will also automatically generate a secondary color and a text color with sufficient contrast.

### Form response auto-save

When filling a form, we store the intermediary responses of the user locally on his or her device. If for some reason a session is interrupted or cancelled, the user can reconvene where they left off without losing data.

### Form layouts

You usually see online forms in two flavors: conversational (display one question at a time) or in a more traditional/regular layout (display all the questions at once). We understand that each of the two form modes can serve a different purpose and use case. That’s you can configure the display mode of a form and choose what works best for your use case and population.

### Custom success and cancel pages

Determine what stakeholders see when they completed all their activities.

### Custom domains

Usually, the standard link Awell generates is good to get you started. But in some cases, your stakeholders may find it confusing if the root domain does not match your brand name or are hesitant to click links that look suspicious. That’s why you can set up a custom domain for your Hosted Pages Links.
