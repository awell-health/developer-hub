description: Learn how to use Hosted Pages to let patients and other stakeholders interact with their pending care flow activities
---

**Awell Hosted Pages is a prebuilt app that allows you to let patients and other stakeholders interact with their pending care flow activities in Awell.** Hosted Pages' [built-in and customizable](/awell-orchestration/docs/interact-with-care-flows/awell-hosted-pages/built-in-and-customizable-features) features reduces your development time and can get you up and running with Awell in no time.

## Low-code integration

Hosted Pages require no to minimal coding and is the best choice for most integrations because of its pre-built functionalities and customization options.

**You can integrate Hosted Pages in two ways:**

1. Hosted Pages Links generated by Awell and sent to your systems at the right time
2. Create a session via our API which will return you a session URL

You can learn more about Hosted Pages Links and Sessions [here](/awell-orchestration/docs/interact-with-care-flows/awell-hosted-pages/sessions-and-links).

Hosted Pages can be embedded in your website/app or you can redirect users to an Awell-hosted page.

## It's not a patient app

**Awell Hosted Pages is not designed as a patient app, nor do we intend to transform it into one.** Its primary and only function is to facilitate interactions for patients and other stakeholders with pending activities in Awell care flows. Once an activity is completed, it becomes inaccessible on Hosted Pages. Unlike typical patient apps, Hosted Pages does not support features like viewing other active tasks, managing user profiles, and more.

Most of our customers already have their own patient app, and they frequently utilize Awell's API to integrate additional functionalities that Hosted Pages don't support, such as browsing care flows. This approach allows them to maintain the use of Hosted Pages for facilitating patient interactions with activities in their care flow, while expanding the capabilities of their proprietary apps.

## Authentication and security

**Users don't need to authenticate with Awell in order to gain access to Hosted Pages.** All that's needed is a link that brings you to Awell Hosted Pages. **However, these links are unique per care flow and per stakeholder.** In Awell, actions or activities are assigned to a stakeholder, this tells the system who needs to complete the activity. Therefore, a link only gives access to the pending activities for a specific care flow and stakeholder.

In certain scenarios, users may need to log into a proprietary app before accessing Awell Hosted Pages through a provided link. In other situations, patients might receive the link directly via email or SMS. Regardless of the method, each of these channels is usually safeguarded by its respective physicial and logical security measures.

**Given the transient nature of the content on Hosted Pages (where only pending activities can be completed), the uniqueness of links for each care flow and stakeholder, and the external security measures in place before accessing these links**, Hosted Pages is a secure way to get started with Awell fast.

## Content

Hosted Pages enables patients and other stakeholders to interact with their pending activites in care flows. In Awell, we differentiate between activities that necessitate user involvement for completion, known as user activities, and those that don't, referred to as system activities.

**Hosted Pages specifically display activities that require user interaction, such as:**

- Forms
- Messages
- Checklists
- Custom actions from extensions that require a user to complete them (e.g. signing a document, uploading an image)

Activities like API call actions and calculations, which don't need user intervention, are not presented on Awell Hosted Pages.

## Alternatives

**The alternative to using Hosted Pages is building a custom interface that allows patients and other stakeholders to interact with pending care flow activities directly into your website.** In this scenario, your stakeholders will interact with their activities right on your website or app, without being redirected to an external page.

When you choose this option, you're responsible for not only building the interface but also maintaining it. If you choose this route, you'll need to find the right developer, engineer and design resources to create the interfaces, update it and keep it functioning.

The beauty of Awell Hosted Pages is how they neutralise this pressure but still allow a high degree of customisation. **We are committed to maintaining and evolving Hosted Pages so you don't have to build it.**

## FAQ

**How are you auditing access to data without an authentication context?**<br/>
In Hosted Pages, there's no authenticated context. Instead, access is managed within a “session” scoped to specific roles, such as “patient” or “clinician.” This approach allows for role-based access, but no individual user context is logged within this session, meaning there is currently no auditing available at the user level.

**How do you prevent anyone with a valid link access to patient data or patient data outside of their scope of service?**<br/>
There are a combination of elements to consider:

1. <span className='font-bold'>Limited Data Exposure</span>:<br/>
We recommend not exposing sensitive PHI/PII data within Hosted Pages. The app is designed as a lightweight, low-setup application that enables users to complete activities in care flows without requiring a full authentication setup.
2. <span className='font-bold'>Short-Lived Sessions</span>:<br/>
Sessions in Hosted Pages are short-lived, expiring after one hour. For most integrations, a session must be created via our API, which requires authentication.
3. <span className='font-bold'>Contextual Guardrails</span>:<br/> Depending on your use case and integration setup, the session link can be generated within an authenticated context (e.g. inside your EHR), providing an implicit layer of access control. However, if a link were to be leaked, anyone with access could potentially view it for up to one hour.
4. <span className='font-bold'>Embedded in Authenticated Apps</span>:<br/> Many customers use an embedded version of Hosted Pages within their own authenticated applications.
5. <span className='font-bold'>Additional Verification Measures</span>:<br/> We also started supporting optional verification steps, such as date-of-birth (DOB) verification. Before accessing Hosted Pages, users are prompted to enter a specific piece or combination of personal data about the patient, like DOB, before they can access the Hosted Pages session.
