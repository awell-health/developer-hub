## Integration
This integration enables you to orchestrate activities over time for multiple stakeholders on an Awell hosted activities page. The basic integration is the same as the one explained for the [Hosted pathway](/awell-orchestration/docs/integrations/hosted-pathway) integration. Additionally, this integration allows you to:
- Create a patient before starting a pathway
- Set up webhooks to be notified of pending activities, forms submitted or data points collected in active pathways
- Proactively request pending activities for a specific stakeholder at any time

Optionally, you can set up an integration with Elastic to access your data.
