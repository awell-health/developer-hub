title: Versioning with Awell Orchestration
description: Learn more about how versioning works when Orchestrating care flows

**Every time a care flow is published in Awell Studio, a new version is created for that care flow.** Every version represents an immutable snapshot of the state of all the components associated with that care flow at the time of publishing. [Before moving on, we recommend reading more about how versioning works in Awell Studio](/awell-studio/docs/getting-started/versioning).

### Starting a care flow

When you enroll a patient in a care flow, the Orchestrator will enroll the patient in the version of the care flow [that is set as the live version](/awell-studio/docs/getting-started/versioning#set-the-live-version).

### Migrate patients from one version to another

It might be that you've included a patient in version 1 of your care flow but you're ready to publish version 2 and you're wondering whether you can "upgrade" the patients enrolled in previous versions to the latest version.

Unfortunately, that's not possible yet but we're working on improved support with the ability to upgrade started care flows/pathways to a newer version.
