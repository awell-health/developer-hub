title: Sessions and Links
description: Learn how to obtain an URL to Hosted Pages for your stakeholders
---

**You will need a URL in order to direct a patient or other stakeholder to Hosted Pages.** There are two options to obtain such a URL: [Hosted Pages Links](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/sessions-and-links#hosted-pages-links) and [Sessions](/awell-orchestration/docs/activities/awell-hosted-pages/sessions-and-links#sessions) (with session URLs).

Both Hosted Pages Links and Sessions serve the same purpose: there is a new activity in the care flow that requires a stakeholder's attention (e.g. a form to fill). In order to let the stakeholder complete the activity, we need a URL that allows the stakeholder to complete the activity on Hosted Pages.

## Hosted Pages Links

**Hosted Pages Links are the quickest way to get started sending your stakeholders to Hosted Pages and let them complete activities.** It requires zero engineering resources as they are generated by Awell and sent to your system or directly to the stakeholder via SMS, email, or other channels at the right time.

Hosted Pages Links are **static**, **don't expire**, but are **unique per stakeholder per care flow**. A single link thus only gives access to pending activities in one care flow and one stakeholder.

**Although Hosted Pages Links are generated by Awell, it's up to you, the care flow builder, to insert these links in the appropriate actions of the care flow.** You can find more information about how to that in this [help article](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/8205630-care-flow-design-when-using-hosted-pages). A couple of examples:

1. You can insert the link in the body of a text message and send it to the patient via Twilio. When the patient receives the text message, they can click the link and interact with their pending care flow activities.
2. You can insert the link in the payload of an API call action which calls your system when a patient needs to complete an activity. You take care of notifying the patient and upon acting on that notification, you can use the link we sent you to direct the patient to Hosted Pages to complete their pending activities.

## Sessions

**A Hosted Pages Session is a programmatic representation of what a single stakeholder sees as they complete pending activities in a care flow.** You, the customer, create these sessions programmatically [using Awell's API](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-hosted-pages-session). When setting up a session, you need to specify details like who the session is for, the care flow involved, and a success URL where stakeholders are sent after they complete all activities. This setup shapes what activities a stakeholder can interact with and how things work once they're done. After creating a Hosted Pages Session, redirect your stakeholder to the Sessionâ€™s URL to let them complete their pending activities.

A session **expires after 60 minutes** but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a pathway.

Additionally, sessions also support [webhooks](/awell-orchestration/docs/data/webhooks-and-events) which allows you to be notified when a session is started, completed, or expired.

## Comparison

Ultimately, both Sessions and Hosted Pages Links result in a URL that directs you to Hosted Pages. What distinguishes the two, and how does one decide which to use?

    ** There are use cases, like onboarding and intake flows, where you might
    want a stakeholder (e.g. a patient) to start a care flow themselves and
    immediately let them complete activities in their care flows. Both for Links
    and Sessions there is an easy way to do that. Read more about that in{' '}

    <strong>Example:</strong> a patient visits your website and there's a button
