title: Sessions and Links
description: Learn how to obtain an URL to Hosted Pages for your stakeholders
---

You will need a URL in order to redirect (or embed) a patient or other stakeholder to Hosted Pages. There are two options to obtain such a URL: Sessions (with session URLs) or Hosted Pages Links.

## Sessions

**A Hosted Pages Session is a programmatic representation of what a single stakeholder sees as they complete pending activities in a care flow.** You, the customer, create these sessions [using Awell's API](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-hosted-pages-session). When setting up a session, you need to specify details like who the session is for, the care flow involved, and a success URL where stakeholders are sent after they complete all activities. This setup shapes what activities a stakeholder can interact with and how things work once they're done. After creating a Hosted Pages Session, redirect your stakeholder to the Sessionâ€™s URL to complete their activities.

A session expires after 60 minutes but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a pathway.

### Lifecycle

1. When Awell notifies you via the `activity.created` webhook or through a specific action in the care flow, such as an API call, indicating that a stakeholder needs to complete an activity in a care flow, [your application creates a new Hosted Pages Session which will give you access to a session URL](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-hosted-pages-session).
2. You embed (or redirect to) Hosted Pages as an iframe in your app so the stakeholder can interact with their pending activities.
3. The stakeholder completes all their pending activities.
4. (optional) When all pending activities are completed, you can subscribe to the `session.completed` webhook to trigger any kind of post-completion logic on your end.
