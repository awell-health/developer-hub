Awell Hosted Pages is a low-code integration allowing your patients and clinical stakeholders to interact with care flow activities like filling forms and reading messages. You can embed Hosted Pages directly in your website or redirect users to an Awell-hosted page. **It is the quickest way to get started with Awell.**

## Stripe analogy

When you are looking to implement payments into your application, chances are high you will consider using a platform like Stripe to collect payments from your users.

To collect a payment from a user, you will need to have some kind of payment page where the user can see the amount they need to pay and enter their payment details. You can do this by building a completly custom payment page on top of Stripe's API or you can leverage [Stripe's Prebuilt Checkout Page](https://stripe.com/en-gb-be/payments/checkout).

## Branding

You can customize the look and feel of the Awell Hosted Pages. Via the Awell apps you can:

- Upload a logo
- Customize the page's accent color and page title

<Alert type="info" title="Setting a new accent color">
  <p>
    When you set a custom accent color, all UI components will automatically be
    rebranded based on that accent color. Awell will also automatically generate
    a secondary color and a text color with sufficient contrast which will be
    applied to the UI components.
  </p>
