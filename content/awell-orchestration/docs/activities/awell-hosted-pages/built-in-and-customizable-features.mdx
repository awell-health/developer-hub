### Form response auto-save

When filling a form, we store the intermediary responses of the user locally on his or her device. If for some reason a session is interrupted or cancelled, the user can reconvene where they left off without losing data.

### Built for global usage

Awell Hosted Pages has built-in support for internationalization. The UI like buttons, loading indicators, etc can be served in the language of the user. The app is currently avaialble in English, Dutch, French, Romanian, and Estonian. Languages can easily be added so let us know if there is a language you would like to use which is not in the list.

### Your brand in the spotlight

Customize Awell Hosted Pages' accent color, logo, and page title to match the look and feel of your brand. This makes sure your users have a seemless experience across the board.
