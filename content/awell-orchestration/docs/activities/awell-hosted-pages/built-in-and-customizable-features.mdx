<Alert type="info" title="Setting a new accent color">
  <p>
    When you set a custom accent color, all UI components will automatically be
    rebranded based on that accent color. Awell will also automatically generate
    a secondary color and a text color with sufficient contrast which will be
    applied to the UI components.
