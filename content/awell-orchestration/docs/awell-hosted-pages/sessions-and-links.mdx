title: Sessions and Links
description: Learn how to obtain an URL to Hosted Pages for your patients and other stakeholders
---

**You will need a URL in order to direct a patient (or other stakeholder) to Hosted Pages.** There are two options to obtain such a URL: [Hosted Pages Links](#hosted-pages-links) and [Sessions](#sessions) (with session URLs).

Both Hosted Pages Links and Sessions serve the same purpose: there is a new activity in the care flow that requires a patient's attention (e.g. a form to fill). In order to let the patient complete the activity, we need a URL that allows them to complete the activity on Hosted Pages.

## Comparison

Ultimately, both Sessions and Hosted Pages Links result in a URL that directs you to Hosted Pages. What distinguishes the two, and how does one decide which to use?

    ** There are use cases, like onboarding and intake flows, where you might
    want a patient to self-enroll in a care flow and immediately let them
    complete activities in their care flow. Both for Links and Sessions there is
    an easy way to do that with a{' '}

    <strong>Example:</strong> a patient visits your website and there's a button
    to start an onboarding flow. Clicking the button should both start a care
    flow and immediately allow the patient to complete activities in that care
    flow.

## Hosted Pages Links

**Hosted Pages Links are the quickest way to get started sending your patients to Hosted Pages and let them complete activities.** It requires zero engineering resources as they are generated by Awell and sent to your system or directly to the patient via SMS, email, or other channels at the right time.

Hosted Pages Links are **static**, **don't expire**, and are **unique per patient per care flow**. A single link thus only gives access to pending activities in one care flow and one patient.

**Although Hosted Pages Links are generated by Awell, it's up to you, the care flow builder, to insert these links in the appropriate actions of the care flow.** You can find more information about how to that in this [help article](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/8205630-care-flow-design-when-using-hosted-pages). A couple of examples:

1. You can insert the link in the body of a text message and send it to the patient via Twilio. When the patient receives the text message, they can click the link and interact with their pending care flow activities.
2. You can insert the link in the payload of an API call action which calls your system when a patient needs to complete an activity. You take care of notifying the patient and upon acting on that notification, you can use the link we sent you to direct the patient to Hosted Pages to complete their pending activities.

## Sessions

**A Hosted Pages Session represents your patient's session as they complete activities in their care flow through Hosted Pages.** Sessions are created just-in-time and programmatically by you, the customer, [using Awell's API](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-hosted-pages-session).

When creating a session, you need to specify details like who the session is for, the care flow involved, and a success URL where patients are sent after they complete all activities. This setup shapes what activities a patient can interact with and how things work once they're done. After creating a Session, redirect your patient to the Sessionâ€™s URL to let them complete their pending activities.

A session **expires after 60 minutes** but the timer is reset after every completion of an activity. A session also expires when there are no pending activities left in a care flow.

Additionally, sessions also support [webhooks](/awell-orchestration/docs/data/webhooks-and-events) which allows you to be notified when a session is started, completed, or expired.
