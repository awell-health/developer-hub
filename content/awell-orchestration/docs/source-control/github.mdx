## Create a New Git Repository

Begin by setting up a dedicated Git repository for Awell's Source Control. While you can link to an existing repository, starting fresh with a new one is advised for optimal integration. This approach not only ensures a clean slate but also provides you with a unique URL for your project. Remember to copy this new URL once created, as you'll need it for subsequent steps. Here's what your new repository's URL will look like:

https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;

## Enter your URL into Awell

To integrate your repository with Awell, follow these steps:

- Go to the Care flow that you want to source control.
- Click on the **Settings** tab.
- Under the settings menu, on the left, click on **Source Control**.
- Paste your new URL from the previous step into the **GitHub repository URL** field.

## Branch Name

Under the **GitHub repository URL**, write the name of the branch you would like your care flow to be pushed to. If you are unsure what to name it, we recommend using `Main`.

## Create a Fine-grained Personal Access Token

Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub to allow Awell to interact with your repository:

1. Navigate to **Profile > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Fine-Grained Tokens** on GitHub.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the [Managing your personal access tokens - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
3. Under **Repository permissions**, change the contents option to **Read-and-Write** access.

## Copy the Generated Token into Awell

- Go to the Care flow you want to source control.
- Click on the **Settings** tab.
- Under the settings menu, on the left, click on **Source Control**.
- Paste your new token from the previous step into the **GitHub access token** box.

## Hit Save

**Do not forget to hit the Save button** on the bottom right and BAM! Your care flow is now source-controlled.

> **NOTE:** Every time you publish a care flow it will be pushed to the GitHub repository.
