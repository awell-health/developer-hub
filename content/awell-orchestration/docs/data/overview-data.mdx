## Webhooks & events

You can leverage webhooks to track events happening within Awell and send them to any destination (Segment, Amplitude, Google Analytics, ...).

## Connect to Awell's data repository (Elastic)

We use Elastic as our data repository to store, index, and search pathway data sets. You can either **connect your own BI tool** to our data repository in Elastic or **use our analytics & dashboarding tool: Kibana**.

Both Elastic and Kibana are running on our own infrastructure.

## Create dashboards with Kibana

We use Kibana for dashboarding & data visualization. If you choose to work with Kibana (and not your own BI tool), then we create accounts so you can log in into the tool. In Kibana, you're able to create an unlimited amount of dashboards.

Integrations with your identity provider to log into Kibana are possible.
