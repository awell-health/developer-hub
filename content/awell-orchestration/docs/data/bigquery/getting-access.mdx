There are two ways to access your BigQuery datasets: **BigQuery Studio** and **Service Accounts**.

## BigQuery Studio

We can invite you to BigQuery Studio, which will allow you to discover, explore, and analyze your Awell datasets directly using the tools and interfaces provided by BigQuery Studio. **This requires you to have a Google account.**

You can learn more about BigQuery Studio [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-overview#bigquery-studio).

## Service Accounts

**This option is ideal if you want to connect your BI tools or data platforms to the BigQuery datasets.** In this scenario, you might not be using BigQuery Studio to explore datasets but your own BI and data platforms. The Service Account will provide the necessary credentials to establish and maintain a secure, read-only connection between your preferred data platform and BigQuery.

Service Account credentials are shared as a JSON key file. One Service Account can give access to datasets in one or multiple environments (e.g., Sandbox & Production).

## Requesting access
