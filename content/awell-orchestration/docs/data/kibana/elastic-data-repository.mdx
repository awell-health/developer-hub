description: Understand what is available in the Elastic data repository

We use Elastic as our data repository to store, index, and search pathway data sets. You can either connect your own BI tool to our data repository in Elastic or use our analytics & dashboarding tool: Kibana.

The data repository contains two different types of data: collected data and generated data.

**Collected data** refers to any atomic piece of data collected from a user or system in care flows (e.g. form responses, calculation results, etc.). These are the datapoints that you can find in the [data catalog](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/4791428-data-catalog) in Awell Studio and that you can use to build care flows.

**Generated data** refers to data generated by the orchestration of the care flow itself, i.e. data about which actions were orchestrated when in care flows.

## Collected data

All the collected data is stored in a single index: `orchestration-datapoint`.

This index uses a normalized structure to handle the fact that the collected data can have different value types (string, boolean, numeric, date etc), and can come from many different sources (forms, calculations, Extensions, etc.).

<Alert type="info">
  <p class="mb-1">
    When building a care flow in Awell Studio you have the ability to configure human readable identifiers for all data points as well as the source behind these data points. Our system uses that information to generate a `qualified_key` for each data point which combines the source key and the data point key. Let's imagine that you are building a patient form to collect the patient's weight and height, with the intent of calculating a BMI score. You set the form key to <em>bmi</em>, and set the question keys to <em>height</em> and <em>weight</em> respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will result in data points with the following qualified keys:
    <ul>
      <li><em>bmi.height</em> contains the answer to the <em>height</em> question in the <em>bmi</em> form</li>
      <li><em>bmi.weight</em> contains the answer to the <em>weight</em> question in the <em>bmi</em> form</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the <a href="https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/4791428-data-catalog">
      Data Catalog
    </a> to get an overview of all the collected data points, including the qualified keys and where in your care flow they are collected.

### Sample queries

Given that the data point index is normalised, you can use any combination of the following properties to narrow down the query results:
- Use `data_set_id` or `pathway.id` to narrow down results to the data collected in a specific pathway
- Use `patient.id` to narrow down results to data collected for any pathway started for a specific patient
- Use `data_point_definition.category` to narrow down results to data collected from a specific source category
- Use `data_point_definition.qualified_key` to narrow down results to a specific data point
- Use `data_point_definition.qualified_key` with wildcards to narrow down results to data points that logically belong together

## Generated data

The generated data is stored in three indices:

1. `orchestration-pathway`
2. `orchestration-step`
3. `orchestration-activity`

The pathway and step indices provide a "snapshot" of the status of all pathways and steps that have ever been created in your Awell tenant (e.g. which are still active, which were completed, etc.), while the activity index tells you which system activities have occured to orchestrate your care flows. You can find more information about "activities" in the Awell platform (here)[https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/domain-model#activities].
