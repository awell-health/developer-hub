## Understanding the data schema

### Care flow definition vs Care flow

In the Awell domain, a care flow definition is a care flow template designed in the no-code studio, representing the general structure and components of a care plan without being tied to any specific patient.

A care flow on the other hand is a patient-specific instance derived from a care flow definition that tracks and manages an individual patient's care journey.

### Identifiers

A care flow definition is made of a set of components which have three identifiers: the **definition** identifier, the **published** identifier and the **release** identifier.
- The **definition** identifier is version agnostic, so it remains the same across all published versions of a care flow definition.
- The **published** identifier on the other hand is version specific, so every publication generates a new unique published identifier for each component in a care flow definition.
- The **release** identifier is a unique identifier for the published version itself. It is assigned to all components in that published version.

This provides the flexibility to use two different strategies when referencing components: either by the published identifier, or by a combination of the definition identifier and the release identifier.

In the current version of the schema available in the repository there is only one such relationship: the `data_points` table references the `data_point_definitions` table using the `definition_id` and `release_id` properties. This allows you to easily query the data in those table in a version specific or version agnostic way depending on your use case. Using the `definition_id` you can get data across all published versions of a care flow definition. Using the `definition_id` and `release_id` you can narrow down your query to a specific published version.

### Release vs. Version

In Awell Studio you can see the list of published versions for a given care flow definition with an auto incremented version number. This version number is only used for display purposes. Behind the scenes we assign a unique release identifier to each published version, which you can retrieve through the [Get published pathway definitions query](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways).

The release identifier is guaranteed to be globally unique so it can be safely used as input to build analytics query on the data set.

## Schema

The data repository contains three different types of data: data points, orchestration data and patient data.

**Data points** refers to any atomic piece of data collected from a user or system in care flows (e.g. form responses, calculation results, etc.). These are the datapoints that you can find in the [data catalog](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/4791428-data-catalog) in Awell Studio and that you can use to build care flows.

**Orchestration data** refers to data generated by the orchestration of the care flow itself, i.e. data about which actions were orchestrated when in care flows.

**Patient data** refers to the data you explicitly provide on the patients you enroll in your care flows. When using anonymous patients this only contains identifiers.

### Data points

The data points are stored in two tables: `data_points` and `data_point_definitions`. The `data_points` table uses a normalized structure to handle the fact that atomic data can have different value types (string, boolean, numeric, date etc), and can come from many different sources (forms, calculations, Extensions, etc.).

  <p className="mb-1">
    When building a care flow in Awell Studio you have the ability to configure human readable identifiers for all data points as well as the source behind these data points. Our system uses that information to generate a `qualified_key` for each data point definition which combines the source key and the data point key. Let's imagine that you are building a patient form to collect the patient's weight and height, with the intent of calculating a BMI score. You set the form key to <em>bmi</em>, and set the question keys to <em>height</em> and <em>weight</em> respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will result in data point definitions with the following qualified keys:
    <ul>
      <li><em>bmi.height</em> contains the answer to the <em>height</em> question in the <em>bmi</em> form</li>
      <li><em>bmi.weight</em> contains the answer to the <em>weight</em> question in the <em>bmi</em> form</li>
    </ul>
