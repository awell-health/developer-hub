We use Google Big Query as our data repository to store care flow data sets.

# How to get access

You need a service account to access your Big Query dataset. Please contact your Awell Customer Success Manager to receive your account details.

# Schema

The data repository contains three different types of data: collected data, generated data and patient data.

**Collected data** refers to any atomic piece of data collected from a user or system in care flows (e.g. form responses, calculation results, etc.). These are the datapoints that you can find in the [data catalog](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/4791428-data-catalog) in Awell Studio and that you can use to build care flows.

**Generated data** refers to data generated by the orchestration of the care flow itself, i.e. data about which actions were orchestrated when in care flows.

**Patient data** refers to the data you explicitly provide on the patients you enroll in your care flows. When using anonymous patients this only contains identifiers.

## Collected data

The collected data is stored in two tables: `data_points` and `data_point_definitions`. The `data_points` table uses a normalized structure to handle the fact that the collected data can have different value types (string, boolean, numeric, date etc), and can come from many different sources (forms, calculations, Extensions, etc.).

  <p class="mb-1">
    When building a care flow in Awell Studio you have the ability to configure human readable identifiers for all data points as well as the source behind these data points. Our system uses that information to generate a `qualified_key` for each data point definition which combines the source key and the data point key. Let's imagine that you are building a patient form to collect the patient's weight and height, with the intent of calculating a BMI score. You set the form key to <em>bmi</em>, and set the question keys to <em>height</em> and <em>weight</em> respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will result in data point definitions with the following qualified keys:
    <ul>
      <li><em>bmi.height</em> contains the answer to the <em>height</em> question in the <em>bmi</em> form</li>
      <li><em>bmi.weight</em> contains the answer to the <em>weight</em> question in the <em>bmi</em> form</li>
    </ul>
