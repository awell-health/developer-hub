## Added

### Subscribe Webhooks to events

Before this release, all Webhooks were automatically subscribed to all events in a pathway. With this release, you can now subscribe your Webhooks to specific events.

> All legacy webhooks will stay subscribed to all events so there are no breaking changes for customers that already have an integration with Webhooks. However, please note the change in Webhook event type naming in the ["Deprecated"](#deprecated) section below.

### Contextual information in Webhooks and API calls payload

Webhook and API calls now all have contextual information on the pathway & patient in their payload. This information is disclosed through the `pathway` field in the response object.

```json
{
  ...,
  "pathway": {
    "id": "<PATHWAY_ID>",
    "pathway_definition_id": "<PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID>",
    "patient_id": "<PATIENT_ID>",
    "start_date": "<START_DATE>"
  }
}
```

### Activity IDs in the reminder created payload

In order to support identifying the activites for which a reminder was created, we now include the activity ids in the corresponding Webhook payload.

```json
{
  ...,
  "reminder": {
    ...,
    "new_activities_ids": ["activity_1", "activity_2"]
  }
}
```

## Deprecated

### Webhook event types are renamed

The event types for Webhooks have been renamed. Please note that Webhooks in pathways created prior to this release will still use the old event type names for backwards compatibility. The change is only applicable for newly created Webhooks.

This change was made to simplify the parsing of Webhook event names, following a `<resource>.<event_that_took_place>` format.

<div className="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Renamed event type</th>
        <th>Legacy event type name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>reminder.created</td>
        <td>REMINDER_CREATED</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>activity.completed</td>
        <td>ACTIVITY_COMPLETED</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>activity.created</td>
        <td>ACTIVITY_CREATED</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>data_point.collected</td>
        <td>DATA_POINT_COLLECTED</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>form.submitted</td>
        <td>FORM_SUBMITTED</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### Deprecated context fields in Webhook calls

As part of ["Contextual information in Webhooks and API calls payload"](#contextual-information-in-webhooks-and-api-calls-payload) we will be deprecating the `patient_id`, `pathway_id` and `pathway_definition_id` fields and removing them in a future release. This information can now be found in the `pathway` object.

The fields will still be included in the payload to support legacy integrations but should not be used to set up new integrations.

```json
{
  "pathway_definition_id": "<PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID>", // Deprecated, see 'pathway.pathway_definition_id'
  "pathway_id": "<PATHWAY_ID>", // Deprecated, see 'pathway.id'
  "patient_id": "<PATIENT_ID>", // Deprecated, see 'pathway.patient_id'
  "pathway": {
    "id": "<PATHWAY_ID>",
    "pathway_definition_id": "<PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID>",
    "patient_id": "<PATIENT_ID>",
    "start_date": "<PATHWAY_START_DATE>"
  }
}
```
