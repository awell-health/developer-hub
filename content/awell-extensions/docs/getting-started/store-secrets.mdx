**Secrets or environment variables are not stored in the extension code**. Instead, they should be managed through [Extension settings](/awell-extensions/docs/getting-started/extension-settings). All you have to do is define these settings in the extension code and then use them in your custom actions. 

When users install your extension, they can securely configure the settings within the Awell Platform. Since the platform supports multiple environments (e.g., Sandbox, Production), you can assign different values to these settings for each environment during installation. This ensures proper segregation and secure handling of secrets across environments.

## Example

Imagine you are building an extension with a 3rd party. As is common in many applications, your extension might require authentication with the third-party API. However, you want to ensure that users who install the extension can easily configure their own API key without hardcoding it into the extension's code or relying on environment variables.

To achieve this, you can use the extension settings to provide a user-friendly way for extension users to set their API key during the installation process.

### Extension settings

```typescript
const myExtensionSettings = {
  apiKey: {
    label: 'API Key',
    key: 'apiKey',
    obfuscated: true, // set this to true when settings store sensitive data
    required: true,
  },
}

// Export extension with settings
const yourExtension = {
  ...,
  settings: mySettings,
}
```

### Accessing settings in custom actions

The extension settings are accessible from within any part of your extension's code (e.g. when writing a custom action), enabling you to retrieve the user's provided value for the secret/setting.

```typescript
export const yourCustomAction: Action<typeof fields, typeof settings> = {
  ...,
  onEvent: async ({ payload, onComplete, onError, helpers }) => {
    // Fetch the settings
    const { settings } = payload

    // Securely access the API Key set by the user when installing the extension
    console.log(settings.apiKey)

    // Your custom action logic

    // Complete the action
    await onComplete()
  },
}
```
