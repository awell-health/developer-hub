title: Build your own extension
description: This guide covers the prerequisites and tools you need to build an extension on the Awell platform.

## Why build your own extension?

There are two main reasons why you would want to build your own extension.
1. Many Awell customers develop and maintain proprietary apps (patient app, care team portal, even home grown EHRs) as part of their tech stacks. By building a **private** extension, you can allow your non-engineer users to build care flows that drive actions in those apps with our no-code builder.
2. You're a vendor of a tool that is used by care providers and would like to build a **public** extension that is featured on our [Marketplace](https://developers.awellhealth.com/awell-extensions/marketplace) so any Awell customer can build care flows that drive actions in your tool.

## Github repository

Building an extension needs to be done via our `awell-extensions` repository. Check out the repository locally to start contributing and create your first extension!

## Prerequisites

**Before you can create your first extension, make sure you have the following prerequisites.**

1. You are familiar with the Awell Platform and Awell Extensions.
2. You are familiar with **Typescript**.
3. You have familiarity with the **terminal**. You should know how to `cd` into a folder and run commands.
4. You have familiarity with **Github** and know how to contribute to an existing repository.
5. You have **Node.js installed**.
6. You have a text editor installed, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, or Vim. If you're not sure which editor to use, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Yarn

Note that we use yarn PnP which might require additional configuration in your IDE to work properly. If you are using VSCode, use the workspace configuration provided in `.vscode/` and everything will be ready to go.

If you use a different IDE, check the yarn documentation for instructions on IDE setup.
