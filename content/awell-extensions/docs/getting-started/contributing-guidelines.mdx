description: Welcome to Awell's extensions contributing guidelines
---

First of all, thank you for investing your time in contributing to the Awell Platform! Any contribution you make will be reflected on our Github repository ✨.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, please get started with reading the documentation here on the Awell Developer Hub. Here you should find all information to get started.

## Types of contributions

You can contribute to Awell Extensions in several ways. The repository on Github is the place to discuss and collaborate on Awell Extensions. Although the Awell team is responsible for maintaining the repository, we do welcome suggestions and PRs.

### 📣 Dicussions

We are using Discussions as a place to connect with other members of the community and have conversations. We hope that you:

- Ask questions you are wondering about.
- Share ideas.
- Engage with other members leveraging Awell Extensions to build amazing stuff on top of the Awell Platform.
- Welcome others and are open-minded. Remember that this is a community we build together 💪.

### 🐞 Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs related to the Awell Extensions repository. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Before creating a new issue**, always search if the issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

**Please make sure your bug reports are thorough, we advise you to include the following sections:**

1. A quick summary and/or background on the issue
2. Steps to reproduce the issue. Try to be specific and include sample code if possible.
3. What you expected would happen
4. What actually happens
5. Notes - possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work

### 🛠️ Create an extension

We welcome everyone to create new extensions for the Awell Platform.

## Pull requests

If you want to create a new extension, fix an issue, or suggest changes in the repository, you should always use a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

### Expected turnaround time for reviews

At Awell, we can commit to reviewing and providing comments on customer pull requests in the following amount of time:

- Small PRs (<5 files, <100 LOC) will be reviewed in *48 hours*.
- Medium PRs (5-20 files, 100-500 LOC) will be reviewed within *72 hours*.
- Large PRs (>20 files, >500 LOC) will be reviewed within *1 week*.

While we do monitor the repository through webhooks and alerts, if you have any specific requests please don't hesitate to @ us in our external slack channel.

### Getting your PR merged

Any PR will ultimately be reviewed by the Awell team before it can be merged to the `main` branch.

**Follow these guidelines to create your PR:**

- Make sure your PR is well-documented so the reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

## Coding style

We use ESLint and Prettier to catch errors early, make code more legible, format our code, and improve overall code quality. Please use the linter for style unification.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the terms of the MIT license. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that is a concern.
