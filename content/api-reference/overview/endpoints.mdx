We have 2 environments you can interact with: **Sandbox** & **Production**. Our production environment is only available for clients with live implementations. Sandbox can be used to explore, test, and develop your integrations.

An API key is needed for both environments in order to intract with our API. See the [Authorization](/api-reference/overview/authorization) section to get more information on how to authorize your API calls.
