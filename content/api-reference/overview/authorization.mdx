To interact with the Awell Orchestration API, you'll need an API key.

## Machine to Machine (M2M) API

**The Orchestration API is a Machine to Machine (M2M) API** and uses a secret API key for authentication and authorization. All requests to the orchestration API should be sent from backend services that can safely and securely access the API key and add it in the relevant header without creating a risk of disclosing the API key.
