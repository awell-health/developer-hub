## Query

```graphql
query GetPathways($filters: FilterPathwaysGraphqlType) {
  pathways(filters: $filters) {
    success
    pathways {
      id
      title
      pathway_definition_id
      patient_id
      status
      status_explanation
      version # version number
      release_id # unique id representing the version
      start_date
      stop_date # if pathway is stopped
      complete_date # if pathway is completed
    }
  }
}
```

## Variables

### Filters

All filter values are optional, if you don't provide any filter all pathways in your organization will be returned.

All `in` filters accept a list of values and result in an `is any of` search criteria. The `eq` filter accepts a single string and results in `is exact match` search criteria.

When specifying multiple filters, the resulting criteria is the conjunction of all filters.

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "pathway_definition_id": {
      "eq": ""
    },
    "patient_id": {
      "in": []
    },
    "release_id: { 
      "in": []
    },
    "start_date": {
      "gte": "",
      "lte": ""
    },
    "status": {
      "in": []
    },
    "version": {
      "in": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Pagination and sorting

Pagination and sorting are highly recommended. Not using pagination means that the API will return all pathways at once which will cause performance issues.

Default sorting is based on the `start_date` field, sorted from newest to oldest (i.e. descending).

```json
{
  "pagination": {
    "offset": 0, // the number of records that need to be skipped
    "count": 20 // the number of results, also known as limit
  },
  "sorting": {
    "sort_field": "start_date",
    "sort_direction": "desc"
  }
}
```
