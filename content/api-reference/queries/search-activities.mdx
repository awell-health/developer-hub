## Query

```graphql
query activities(
  $filters: FilterActivitiesParams
  $pagination: PaginationParams
  $sorting: SortingParams
) {
  activities(filters: $filters, pagination: $pagination, sorting: $sorting) {
    activities {
      id
      stream_id
      date
      subject {
        id
        name
        type
      }
      action
      object {
        id
        name
        type
      }
      indirect_object {
        id
        name
        type
      }
      resolution
      status
    }
  }
}
```

## Variables

### Filters

All filter values are optional, if you don't provide any filter all activities in your tenant will be returned.

All `in` filters accept a list of values and result in an `is any of` search criteria. The `eq` filter accepts a single string and results in `is exact match` search criteria.

When specifying multiple filters, the resulting criteria is the conjuction of all filters.

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "action": {
      "in": []
    },
    "activity_status": {
      "in": []
    },
    "activity_type": {
      "in": []
    },
    "pathway_definition_id": {
      "in": []
    },
    "patient_id": {
      "eq": ""
    }
  }
}
```

### Pagination and sorting

Pagination and sorting are highly recommended. Not using pagination means that the API will return all activities at once which will cause performance issues.

Default sorting is based on the `date` field, sorted descendingly (i.e. newest to oldest).

```json
{
  "pagination": {
    "offset": 0, // the number of records that need to be skipped
    "count": 20 // the number of results, also known as limit
  },
  "sorting": {
    "sort_field": "date",
    "sort_direction": "desc"
  }
}
```
